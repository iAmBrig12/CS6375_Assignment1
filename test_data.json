Well I did and to be honest it wasn't all that I anticipated to be especially for 6oz and 180$. First off the steak was served in 2 pieces. 1 piece was 3 oz and supposedly a section of the ribeye and the other 3 oz piece was the fat cap. I was skeptical about the fact that a chef would serve such a delicate piece of meat decomposed into 2 parts especially one of that quality in this case it was supposedly grade A5. Nevertheless I went with the flow. In my opinion 1 of the 2 pieces of beef was not Wagyu ribeye but rather some other cut of beef. The fat ratio was not present and the 3oz ribeye was not tender. The \"fat cap\" piece was indeed Wagyu quality which I thoroughly enjoyed but the ribeye portion was not. I was disappointed but I didn't let that ruin my experience. The service was fantastic, the best I ever had. Both waiters were attentive and very knowledgeable. The reason why I am giving this 2 stars regardless of the poor food quality is the following, as my friend and I reviewed our 528$ bill for the evening I noticed a random $2 charge listed as a Sauce. I did ask the server to bring me a side of the House sauce but didn't expect he would charge me for it. Not a big deal, I can afford $2 it's the principle that counts. When I asked him about it and told him that I think it was kind of ridiculous that I am being charged an extra $2 for the house steak sauce, the comment was \" that's absolutely right, $2 for the sauce\".

I was shown how to hook up my phone to the vehicle, but only because I openly asked. There was never any time spent to go over what all the dials and knobs did and I have been forced to teach myself. This is all the more frustrating when I was open to come back the next day, but the salesman was dead set on finishing the deal then shorted me because he \"stayed late.\"\nThe bigger frustration came the next day. The initial night I got home late, so did not spend much time reorganizing my vehicle. The next day when I had some time, I realized that the inside was dirty although I was told it was recently detailed, as it was a service loaner. Dust. Dirt on the seats. Personal papers in the glove box. Also a dirty napkin and Combo (yes, the pretzel/cheese snack) on the carpet between seats. Again, car buying is frustrating to begin with, but being actively lied to is absurd.\nAgain, I am happy with my new vehicle, but utterly disappointed with the service I received. The salesman also had the gall to tell me that I will get a survey from Chevrolet to grade his performance and that he does not get a bonus if the highest marks are not given. I can safely say he will not be getting his bonus.

Keep in mind this isn't all of the employees -- some of the employees are perfectly fine and friendly.\n\nAgain, the advantage if quantity over quality -- they are more likely to have something random you're looking for, but their shelves also contain lots of crap in the music/tv/movies section. The organization is generally okay -- it's usually in alphabetical order...usually -- so you shouldn't have too hard a time finding something.\n\nThe weakest section is the music section. There are lots of CD's....but who really buys CDs anymore? The only physical music I buy anymore is vinyl, and their selection isn't great. they have some random new releases, and some old classics....and more Teddy Pendergrass than anyone ever needs. \n\nThe section I spend the most time in is the basement with the comics and toys. I will admit, the inventory of comics is great. They have a ton of comics here, best in the area as far as I can tell. The prices, aren't great. All of the back issues were marked up at least 50 cents more than I find other places. I'm not one to complain about 50 cents, it just discourages me from buying more from them. This is why I only go there for stuff that I haven't found elsewhere. \n\nThe toys are more of a great nostalgic trip than anything I'm exactly interested in buying. They contribute to the ambiance, but I can't see myself actually buying any.

The 35-minute sermon was inconsistent and lacking in a Biblical message.\n\nThe sermon started out saying it was about a passage in the book of Nehemiah.  And for about a minute Pastor Brad Larson talked about the book of Nehemiah.  But never during the remaining sermon did he ever return to the book of Nehemiah or relate anything back to it.  The sermon ended up being what I'd classify as a somewhat secular motivational speech, peppered with random Bible verses from all over the Bible that didn't really fit.  It's like the random Bible verses were forced into the message to attempt to give the overall message some scriptural legitimacy.  It was just a very convoluted message where the Bible wasn't the center of the message.  We left the service thinking it was more of an \"experience\" than \"worship.\"\n\nWhen we got home, I went to the Church's website to read more about the church and about Pastor Larson.  As his biography on the church's website didn't say a lot, I went to Google and discovered that he has no theological education and no seminary degrees.  His time in college was spent studying Business Administration and until recently his career was with GoDaddy as an account executive.  Google searches also show allegations of impropriety while with GoDaddy.  Pastor Larson is a great public speaker and obviously has great skills as a motivational speaker, but we're uncomfortable with his lack of Biblical training and lack of seminary education.\n\nIn seeking a church, we believe a church should be founded on the Bible, with pastors who have been trained in seminary to understand and teach the Bible.

I pointed out to her that we'd been there waiting for quite awhile, and since the ingredients for the meal I was ordering are the same as the others, I was hoping she could ask the kitchen (or the manager, or whoever) if they could make an exception (a 6-minute exception) as I'd prefer the sandwich.

Though the michelada I had was delicious, we were disappointed with the excess of salty butter flavor and lack of creaminess of the queso.

Phoebe took it back and did not charge us, but I found it odd that they weren't interested in why we disliked it.\n\nFor entrees we ordered tacos. I'm a vegetarian so got two plantain tacos with a side of cilantro lime brown rice. The food came out quickly. The tacos are a la carte and do not come with any avo/guac or limes so we ordered lime and guac on the side.

It was ok, but in the end I wasn't a fan. The place was missing a lot. Maybe it's because I came for sushi and it's not a place fully devoted to sushi, or maybe I'm just picky.\n\nWe had a reservation for 6:30 and were sat within under a minute. The restaurant itself was not what I expected. It was a bit too big and bright for my taste. I prefer a quieter establishment when I eat sushi, and this place was so loud that there was a lot of \"huh?\" and what?\" between the miss' and I. Our server was attentive but pretty impersonal and we felt pretty rushed. I'm sure a good part of it was that it was a busy night and maybe he was just swamped. \n\nAnother issue I had was with the sushi menu. It was LAME. When I go to a sushi place, I want to see the chef's super duper fancy rolls. Sabi's menu was very lacking in this regard and the menu was made up of pretty \"meh\" rolls. We ended up ordering a Dragon roll, California roll, and Phili roll. Oh, and one other thing I have to say is that the draft beers are a varied selection and come at a cheap price.\n\nWe started with an appetizer of fried calamari (one of my weaknesses). Sabi's calamari is fried in a tempura batter and served with plenty of pepper and a spicy sauce. I've never had fried calamari tempura-style, and I never will again. It's a heavy coating and proved to be too heavy for the calamari as I tasted more fried goodness than seafood. I have nothing against fried food, but I'm extra judgemental of calamari and the lack of taste was sad. In it's defense I have to say that the sauce was pretty good and complimented the tempura well.\n\nThe rolls were average, if not a little below. They were very \"ricey\" so they were heavier than what I'm used to in sushi rolls. The California roll was pretty bland, even with the extra fish they layer on top. The Dragon roll was my favorite of the three but it was still nothing that blew my mind. As for the Phili roll...we haven't had that in quite a number of years. I guess we felt that we \"graduated\" beyond such \"beginner rolls\". Yet with such a blah menu where nothing really jumped out at us, we decided to have a blast from the past with the Phili. It was ok, but nothing special.\n\nI think my biggest problem with Sabi is that it just doesn't stand up to other restaurants I've been to. A place I consider \"average\" goes about one or two steps above Sabi.

He even said they test ran the car and the noise was gone.\n\nNeedless to say, I got the job I assumed my car needed at another repair shop and guess what, Greg, the noise is GONE!! All it needed was new brake pads and a new front left rotor... lol. ALSO FOR WAY CHEAPER! Greg was trying to scam me again $501.18 to fix the issue he should have fixed the FIRST time. Greg even tried to tell me it was a new noise when I clearly wrote in their check in forms the previous time to check a noise in the front left tire of the car. He accused me of being a liar and I reminded him that I wrote that on the receipts. So we went and checked. When I asked to see them he said \"You should have your own copies!\" He was reluctant to show me the proof but eventually gave in and..lo and behold. I was right..it wasn't a new noise.\n\nAnyway, I will share with you a youtube video. The first 2 minutes go into detail of how a car's brakes work since apparently you didn't know. MY ISSUE SPECIFICALLY is explained at 1:28 to 1:40 minute marks in the video. Remember, I told you, its a rhythmic pattern that you hear at low cruise but speeds up with the car and stops when you apply the breaks.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZvtjnxpFRbU\n\nAlso, I would have had NO ISSUE getting it fixed whatever it took, but Greg's MISDIAGNOSIS led me to believe him and spend $494.35 for a job that I did not go in for. He kept emphasizing how he and his shop are honest, but so far it seems not. Also, they WILL NOT correct their mistake. So save yourself the trouble and look for a REAL mechanic.\n\n\nI will also write another review on the experience prior to this one. You may ask yourself. \"Why do you keep coming back?\" Not by will..but so that they would be men of worth and correct themselves but instead they just deny everything and don't want to be honest.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "This place is like a zoo just run by animals literally I stayed waiting in line for 10 minutes and there was a couple a head of me waiting there for an extra 5 minutes and I said you know what I'm out of here I'm going to Carls Jr.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "I fly for a major airline and as a result of our company's contract w this hotel, I've been a guest at least 10 times.

Last night was my fifth visit and I just can't get this place over 3 stars, average.\n\nThe GOOD:  food is reasonably priced and the menu and decor definitely reminds me of Montauk (small part of Long Island, a.k.a. The Hampdens where Manhattanites flee the summer heat).  The FISH TACOS have very clean flavor and very fresh fish but simply do not meet \"cravable\" status like Coconuts.  I think this because the slaw they are using is standard fare with no unique style.  The kitchen is great at adjusting to requests so maybe they will turn it up.  Other reviewers are chatting up the CAULIFLOWER FRIED RICE.  I agree, this is pleasantly flavorful.  I recommend getting it with lobster chunks as the dish is already slightly dry on the palate and white meat chicken enhances that negative.  A touch of an infused olive oil tossed in at the end would go a long way toward improving this one but still kudos for the creativity.  The LOBSTER ROLL (HOT) is a hit.  There is a place in Manhattan, called Mary's Fish Camp, that gets all kinds of positive press.  This dish could seamlessly jump on the menu and hold its own.\n\nOn one occasion (last night) the service was particularly chaotic and completely malfunctioned when a bachelorette party landed with their dick straws and selfie sticks.  The Manager came over after we had a series of post-meal drink misfires and chopped our $300 bill in half.  I would have settled for a round on the house but the Manager is clearly tuned for keeping this place in a good light.  I don't know if he recognized us as returning customers or this is his policy but that level of Manager awareness and remedy is very commendable.\n\nCircling back to the scene, there is a solidly fun vibe to this beach house-style decor.  The DJ seems to never stop and plays a great spread of tracks. The upper deck couches are fun and comfortable and the table booths are equally set up to enjoy dinner while still being inside the buzz.  I would kick this whole review up a star if the house would grasp the concept that even Friday's understands...as the crowd grows, the music should NOT.  At risk of echoing the comments of other reviewers and sounding twenty years older, the scene is best early, ahead of the place reaching 50% capacity.   Look, we all like to feel the thump of base in our chests and rhythm in our feet but not at the expense of yelling at the persons we came with standing the length of a soda straw away.  I could get the same effect and a lower bar bill by just hanging at the bar, putting my friends on FaceTime then asking them to hit mute on their end.\n\nTHE MEDIOCRE:  Service is organizationally novice but the staff is incredibly upbeat and friendly, clearly trying with great intent.  Super friendly, just unskilled.  Plus, there are a number of menu misses.  Every version of their French fries are unimpressive.  Not bad per say, just unimaginative.  Buffalo-style anything is a nod to drunk frat boys blowing their money for the night on over priced drinks but realizing they gotta eat.  And putting that same Franks Red Hot sauce on potato chips is equally a miss.  The Mac-and-Cheese falls short of getting any attention.  In fact I had to rebook at the bill to even remember we ordered it.\n\nTHE BAD:  I have already crossed the noise level discussion.  The drinks are weak and even for Old Town, priced too high.  If you are going to charge $15 for Hendrick's , St. Germaine and soda then make it in a clean glass, make it constantly each time I order it consecutively and actually use Hendrick's.

To add insult to injury I was charged additionally for the callus remover than I have never gotten in the 5 years of going there. And the cherry on top- an infected toe from removing too much cuticle which cause pain and bleeding at the time of service. Disappointment. Pain(literally), and regret sum up my visit. Enough to make it my last time.

I was mislead by the location because of the picture but that is on me. The following is the complaint I will be submitting to the American Psychiatric Association for the treatment I received at her office:\nI visited Dr. Saleha Baig's office on 9/19/17 at 4pm with an appointment time of 4:15. I knew I would need to fill out new patient paperwork so I arrived early. After completing the paperwork, I was waiting in the waiting room with about 4 other patients. Dr. Baig's office door was left open and I could clearly hear every conversation with every patient. This made me question her confidentiality of patient information but I was in need of a new doctor for a prescription refill so I continued to wait. After two hours of waiting I finally was called back to Dr. Baig's office. Her door was still left open when I came in but I was the last patient since it was just after 6pm. She proceeded to greet me and I began to tell her a bit about my background. Then she asked if I was still taking the medications (she said about five different medications) and I said no I had no idea what she was talking about and then she called me by the wrong patient last name and she realized I not only I was a completely different patient, but I was a brand new patient. She then immediately stood up and started yelling for her receptionist Diane. Diane then entered Dr. Baig's office and Dr. Baig was scolding her in front of me about not scheduling new patients at six o'clock. That is when the receptionist informed her that my appointment was at 4:15 and I had been waiting the whole time. Dr. Baig continued to scold her saying she could not have new patients after four and that the receptionist is overbooking her and this is unacceptable. I then told Dr. Baig she did not need to see me and I could find another doctor. Dr. Baig said I could stay and she would see me but continued to scold the receptionist, and explain that she would need to pray and then see me (I have no prejudice against anyone's beliefs or practices but this would have meant more waiting and I already felt like I was a burden to her at this point). I began to cry because the reason for my visit was a decline in my mental well being and overwhelming stress, in which this instance with Dr. Baig reprimanding her receptionist was causing me more stress. I asked the receptionist and Dr. Baig to destroy my file because I would be seeing a new doctor. About thirty minutes after I left I received a call from Dr. Baig's office and it was Dr. Baig herself. She apologized for acting in that matter, saying she had not used the restroom since the morning and she was very stressed out. I have this voicemail on my phone and I am willing to share it if needed. I find this extremely inappropriate to say as a mental health specialist, especially since I am a teacher and understand that I cannot blame my actions in front of a classroom of students for simple reasons such as not using the restroom. I felt all of Dr. Baig's actions were extremely inappropriate and now I am frantically trying to find a new mental health provider to refill my current prescription and now to help me overcome the stress of my current situation and the situation I encountered with Dr. Baig. As a mental health provider, Dr. Baig should be much more aware of her actions and the way she communicates with her staff, especially in front of a brand new patient. I will be making my insurance aware of Dr. Baig's behavior so that they may consider taking her off the list of in network providers because I would not want anyone else to have to endure that kind of behavior. I would like confirmation that Dr. Baig has been made aware of this situation and hopefully reprimanded for how the situation unfolded.\n\nI will be posting this on as many public forums as possible.

The staff at Waterfront were pleasant enough and there was impressive high tech equipment, but the dentist was very alarmed at how much recession I had in my gums. He said I might need grafting surgery, but he recommended a revolutionary cutting edge treatment that only he does (~$700). And he did not recommend whitening because he thought it would be too painful for me. So I didn't get the whitening, instead, all I acquired was insecurity and fear about my teeth which I'd never had before. I visited my regular dentist a month later and he asked me questions like \"is it bothering you?\" and when I said no, he recommended keeping an eye on it if the recession progresses, but it's nothing to worry about.

I tried to chalk it up to being a Friday night, but out server's behavior over the dessert menu was appalling. My boyfriend wanted to order me some dessert to celebrate my birthday, but I was insisting I was too full for it (especially for another $20 on a slice of cake). My boyfriend still tried to let my server know that it was a special occasion for us and our server responded with \"We would have been able to do something, but you declined to order dessert\" loud enough for me to hear. Upon seeing the disgusted look on my face the server said \"Let me see what I can do\". He then brought out a plate with three of the smallest cream puffs I have ever seen and a candle and just set it on the table with the check and walked away. Let me begin by saying that I was fine with not having any dessert or candles, and my boyfriend was only trying to make me feel special, but what the server said and how he acted was service that I have NEVER received anywhere, let alone somewhere where dinner for two cost us over $150. I have eaten on the patio at Mon Ami Gabi across the street at Paris for the view of the Belagio water show several times before, and unfortunately that is where I will be returning to. \n\nDisappointed.", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "I can't review the food because we never ate.

The worst food poisoning ever. \n\nMy review will be in 2 parts, the first for the actual food. The second for the day after. \n\nFor the record, I've been eating at Tokyo house roughly 15 years. I work close by, and I've always lived in driving distance. I've LOVED this place since a kid. It use to be run by a little old man and his wife, but is now run by new owners... This is when everything has changed.\n\nI went here last week and ordered Beef Yakisoba, a normal go to for me. I normally ask for it spicy but went regular this time around. Normally I'm asked if I'd like rice or not (which I normally decline as the dish is suppose to be all noodles) I received my food, where immediately I knew something was different. Since there was new owners, I figured there was a new cook and maybe things have just changed. I gave it a shot..... and I've never regretted a decision so much in my life. \n\nThe normal dark consistency of the noodles wasn't there, it was a lite sauce lacking any real vegetables or meat for that matter. In total I counted 7 small pieces of beef. They added rice without asking (eh whatever) but on top of that the portions have changed fairly drastically from what it use to be. I get cutting back on portion sizes, but meat and vegetables to? What am I really paying for here? 8$ for just a bowl of noodles? The taste itself was a little sour, almost not pleasant but I kept going to see if it would grow on me. Inside of the dish were water chestnuts, which were never in before and I enjoy them so no complaints. However biting into them was sour, almost like they were opened and sitting out over night. I stopped with the food about half way through and tossed it in the trash. \n\n------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nDisclaimer: TMI\n\nThe following day 6am strikes me with urgency. My bodys way of letting me know to get up now before you crap the bed. The hail storm of watery half solid chunks of feces spewed from my body with such force the water splashed around in the bowl. I knew today would be a bad day, I call out of a work and attempt to go back to sleep. \n\nWithin 30 minutes I'm up again, my body calling me back to the sacred holy ground which is my toilet. The only way to describe what was happening in there was this... Imagine your a kid again in the pool and you fill up one of those water launchers and then you try to push it out with all your force. At this point I get in the shower and after I try to go back to sleep again.\n\n30 Minutes goes by again, at this point I'm up. As I'm sitting on the toilet for round 3, the urge to puke begins. As I'm bent over the tub praying to Jesus I puke already a sensation rushes down to my sphincter. I jump into the shower and prepare for the worst. Thats when it all happens. Those convulsions you get from puking when you tense up so much you can't control the rest of your body. I release from both ends with such force. I turn on the water and it hits my back like cold little knives cutting my skin. I start to see the remains of one end of my body flow down the drain. I immediately begin to puke again. \n\nThe rest of the day was constantly running back and forth from the bathroom, dry heves, and a fever. I could of went more into detail but I figured I'd spare you all the hardship.\n\nI will never be going back to this restaurant. 15 years and you trying to cut corners on your food has lost you a loyal customer.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "I decided to take my niece out for lunch while home visiting family and she chose Olive Garden..

It is not in the Legend Center. It is caddy-corner to the Legend Center in a strip of similarly upscale restaurants. Don't turn in to the Legend Center because it's one of those nouveau malls made to look like a \"real\" Downtown without the scary people and with only chain stores, so it's hard to get out of.\nI came on the Thursday for their half-off specials, and they were slammed. I was lucky enough to get one of the last seats at the sushi bar (the other two were snatched up right after I sat down) while people waited for tables and stood at the regular bar. For this Thursday special, from what I could tell, only hand rolls (Maki) are half off. The cool-sounding, well-presented, fancy rolls are full price. I watched these things go by all night and got a little jealous.\nBeautiful place. Very chic and hip decor, with the unassuming, art gallery opening electronic music to match. Really mixed crowd though, with a lot of after-work overdressed types and a lot of other younger (I assume) sushi fans.\nI was almost immediately approached by a waiter who filled my water glass and said something like \"Okay, you know the drill, let me know when you're ready\" after he saw me filling out my card.\nI picked a Philly (always a fav of mine, and a real test of a place, I think) and a Manhattan, which I had never heard of, but consists of tuna and avocado.\nReady to give my card to the chefs in front of me, I found that there was no way to do this and this was apparently not the protocol. While I was thinking about this, the waiter (who was super-quick despite covering the entire bar) came up and took it from me. So, yeah, it's not a sushi bar in the sense of most sushi bars. It's really just a place for the losers who come in alone to sit and not feel too awkward or, maybe, pack in a few more chairs into an already crowded restaurant.\nWhile I waited, I scoped out the whole scene a bit more. Lots of 30-something I-wanna-be-seen action going on, especially in the bar area. It almost seemed like a singles, pick-up sort of place.\nThe chefs, a mixture of about seven various Asian folks, and staffed by one Japanese man, who seemed to be the manager, were all crammed into the bar area. But they had it down to a ballet, and did not bump into one another, nor spill anything. Orders were put up and then picked up by the waitstaff. Impressively efficient, at the least, but they kept pulling the hand rolls from somewhere in the depths of the bar, which was a little disconcerting.\nTwo of those were mine and, almost as soon as they were put up not even two feet from where I sat, my waiter grabbed them and brought them over, served on a heart-shaped plate with a typical amount of pickled ginger and wasabi.\nFirst bite was the Philly, and the first thing I noticed was that the rice was warm. Not a big deal, but it was a little off-putting. At least the rice was of good quality. And, as far as the other ingredients, the cucumber was fresh and the cream cheese was ample and pungent enough to be enjoyable. The salmon, however, had a decidedly fishy and unpleasantly aged sense to it. Yeah...\nSo onto the Manhattan, and the first thing I notice is that the avocado is clearly past its prime. Note to restaurants: when avocado starts getting gray, it's time to put it on the value menu and try to find another vendor. It tasted old to boot, and the tuna was actually a bit chewy, although not nearly as fishy as the salmon.\nSo, I know you're thinking \"Yum!\" right now, right? It honestly wasn't terrible, and the whole thing ran me about $8 with tip, but the thought that they were charging $6.50 for these rolls normally and calling them sushi was a little disappointing, to say the least. Like I said though, I was not expecting great sushi by any means, and I now fully understand why there are so few sushi places in the Cleveland area in the first place.\nI'm not the type to put emphasis on atmosphere or service. As long as the food is great, I'm willing to wait an hour, deal with dirty floors, fight with pissy staff, or whatever it takes to get my delicious on.

Just returned from a 4 day stay at the MGM Signature.  We've stayed at the MGM a few times before but chose the Signature because this trip we were bringing the kids along with us and like the fact that the rooms were bigger and away from the smoky casino. When I was researching hotels one of the things that stood out to me on the Signature MGM website was the fact that they had a marketing special offer for a early check in as early as 9am and a late checkout offer as late as 3pm.  I LOVED this offer!  For an additional $20 for the early check in and $20 for the late checkout.  I called the Signature direct to book our stay and told them I wanted the early check in and late checkout.  When I called the night  before to confirm my reservation (which I always do...never want to arrive somewhere only to find they don't have record of your reservation!) they confirmed that I could check in at 9am.  This was great because I planned our flight to arrive in Las Vegas at 9:20am looking forward to having a whole day at the pool and shopping.  Here's where it gets ugly.  We arrive at the Signature at 10am....3 kids and my husband and I.  When I go to the front desk the lady says, sorry ma'am, we don't start check in until 3pm.  I explain that I purchased the early check in for 9am and again she says, sorry ma'am we are still working cleaning rooms from our guests last night.  She seemed to have no knowledge of any type of 'early check in' special that i had purchased.  She says, you can wait and give me your cell number and as soon as a room is available I will call you.  I ask if she has any idea how long it will be and she says, sorry ma'am I don't because housekeeping isn't on the property on this time.  WHAT!? Hands me a few key cards to use the pool and tells me that they have me in a room in Tower 1 but the pool in tower 1 is Adult only so I'll need to use the pools at the other towers....WHAT!  Why would they put our family in tower 1 knowing we have kids.  Whatever.  So we wait in the lobby patiently for 15 minutes.  Not impressed with the first customer service lady that I talked with, I decided to approach another counter agent thinking maybe he'll be more helpful.  WRONG!  Just as bad as the first lady..maybe worse.  As I try to explain the early 9am check in I purchased he says, sorry we're still cleaning rooms from last night and we don't start check in unit 3pm.  Is anyone hearing me?!   I try to explain again my early check in and condescendingly he says, well who did you talk to about that?  I said, it's on your website.  He says well ok I'll have to talk with my manager about that so that they can take it off because we can't guarantee a 9am check in. I said, well I would like to talk to your manager.  He says, no, I said I will let my manager know about your issues.  I said, NO, I would like to speak to your manager myself so I can explain what's going on.  He said, ok fine. He comes back and says my manager will be right with you.  I wait for 15 minutes as I'm watching this manager on her computer.  Doesn't look like she's going to help me anytime soon so I walk over and sit right in front of her on the couch.  FINALLY, she lifts her head up from the computer and says can I help you?  Ugh!  I said yes, I purchased an early check in via your website and I'm being told that you cannot accommodate.  She says, sorry but we don't start check in until 3pm ma'am.  Haven't I heard this before?  These front desk agents just repeat the same line over and over.  I was really hoping to get something different from the Asst. Front Office Manager Ms. Cordero but nope!!  Same thing!  I tell her that I would be much more understanding of the situation if just one of her staff members (including her) would have across more apologetic, helpful, understanding, etc., but not one of them came across this way.  She says I can put a rush on housekeeping and call you when your room is ready that's all she can do for me.  She says she'll need to contact her marketing dept. to explain that they can't accommodate an early 9am check in so the special I purchased shouldn't even be listed.  You know what, Ms. Cordero?  I'm the customer.  I don't care what you need to do to remedy the situation between your front desk and the Marketing Department nor do I need to stand here and listen to YOUR problems.  I want to know what your going to do for ME because my family has booked our airline arrival around your early check in promise.  I ask her, do you have an estimate on when our room will be ready so we can plan if we should go very far?  She says, \"sorry I can't give you a time because if we don't meet that time you will be even more upset\".  I almost had to laugh at this point.  Seriously?  OH MY GOSH.

Overall solid dish, but not worth the $38- we upgraded to a main course portion and it was still TINY!!\n-Dry Aged Bone-In Ribeye for 2 $144: WOW for this dish- they bring over a huge piece of bone-in ribeye and carve it at your table, which is a cool bonus presentation. We ordered it medium rare, and it came out perfect even though our server warned us it might be on the rare side. The ribeye tasted good on it's own, but adding a sauce to dip our meat in would have been a good idea. There was a lot of beef to go around, but I'm not sure it if was worth $144.. maybe $100 or $125 max.\n-Bison Carpaccio (Garlic, Radish Greens, Basil $19): YUM- the bison is sliced super thin and the meat melts in your mouth.

I ordered the lamb dish and my other counterparts ordered the steak, the sea bass and the lobster (among other dishes that I did not try and hence will not review). The server told us that main dishes take about 30mins to make because they are made from scratch. I was perfectly fine with this as it promised to be a great meal.\n\nMy lamb dish was good- alright here it goes: The lamb was cooked well, and it camed with thinly slices potatoes layered with thin pieces of lamb. Separately there were large chunks of lamb that were rubbed in an olive tapenade and cooked that way. To be honest, I have had more flavorful lamb at a lower (almost diner style) restaurants. The lamb was tender but it had no flavor - it didnt seem like it had been marinating in any sauce, and that the cooking time was fast (some of the best lamb dishes get cooked for 8hrs+). The potatoes did not have a lot of seasoning to it and it seemed overall bland. \n\nMy bf's steak was great, juicy and cooked perfectly. The brocolli souffle that came with it, however, was pretty bland and nothing special (hate to say that I have made better broccoli souffles at home). His mom did not like the sea bass at all- thought it had no flavor (it even came with bacon mashed potatoes) and that it wasn't even coocked properly.\n\nFinally, we ordered a chocolate and lime soufflee for dessert. The chocolate one was ok- a little undercooked and lacking fluff. The second one was definitely flulfier, but I could tell the undercooked factor because it tasted predominately like raw egg-whites- not a good sign.\n\nThe service seemed to be impecable except for one giant giant mistake: According to standard table service, servers should wait until all members of the table are done eating before they can remove all plates. However, the servers here did not wait and removed all plates but 1, leaving my bf as the only one still eating at the table. This is very rude because when you remove other people's empty dishes, you make the (still eating) person pressured and rushed to finish, which is not the dining experience you should be creating.\n\nSo there you go folks: my (hopefully) super objective opinion about a fancy 2 michelin star restaurant.

So we asked again about getting some clean cups or glasses to drink out of, he wasn't apologetic at all about the dirty glasses and still poured water into the dirty glasses as if we would still drink it after we had asked for clean glasses, so I reminded him they were nasty. We presented the tickets and he explained that we would need to pay additional $10 each to get the entire salad bar and all the meat service. So we agreed because we wanted to get the total experience, as well I ordered a sprite(that never came). The salad bar was subpar, some items were out and there were not very many to start with. The salad area is very small and crowded, and as soon as we arrived at the bar there were angry customers addressing the manager about the poor selection and some items being out for over 45 mins. The manager apologized to the people complaining and said they had a few new trainees in the kitchen and they couldn't keep up with the crowd that night.

I called ahead looking for a cake that would be big enough to feed 10-12 people. I hoped to get the cake for my mothers birthday. When I called they told me that they had some cakes big enough to feed 10-12 people. The girl on the phone told me they had several cakes available. I paid for it over the phone. When I got there to pick up the cake I was livid. The cake I paid for was over $60, but that's what I expected coming from Las Vegas Cake Boss. But the cake they were trying to say I paid for was smaller than my hand!! Enough to feed 4 people! So the girl takes the cake to the side where another lady looks to be prepping dough for cookies. They talk for about 15 minutes. The girl comes back and tells me I have two options; one, that I can get cup cakes to put around the cake. But I have to pay $4.50 for each additional cupcake! She then tells me my second option is to cut the cake into thin pencil like slices. Seriously?! I told her I wanted the cake I ordered over the phone and paid for. She then opens her cash drawer and tells me here's your money back. That's customer service?! I am beyond frustrated. Will never be purchasing anything from this place.

I have purchased two cars from Henry Brown and was happy with the process as well as their fantastic service department, but based I what I learned AFTER the deal was complete, I will never go there again. They contacted me to trade in my 2015 Encore for a 2017. I went in just to see what kind of price I could get, and thought I was getting a decent deal since my payment and terms were not terribly different. However, I was working with three different sales people because no one had time to dedicate just to my transaction-- they all had appointments coming in and out. When it got to finance, I signed the paperwork thinking that all was as discussed. A couple of weeks later, a new license plate arrived in the mail and I found out they had voided my old personalized plate and kept my registration credit. It cost me almost $100 to get my old plate back. I called the dealership to get my registration credit back, but no one returned my call. Then, when I contacted the warranty company to get a refund on the balance of my warranty, I was told the dealership had taken the $1300 check. I called to find out what happened, left a message, but of course, no one called back.  I called again two days later and spoke to the finance director who said that I had agreed to use that money as a down payment for the new car, and that I had just \"misunderstood\" the deal. I am an English teacher with a master's degree; I did not \"misunderstand\" what was being said. The finance guy said it was the sales person's responsibility because the refund amount was entered as my down payment (no one in sales EVER mentioned that little detail), and the sales department says it wasn't them, it was finance who handled that part. In effect, sales put it in as a down payment without my knowledge or consent, and finance slid it by in the paperwork. I should have more thoroughly read every paper I signed, but I stupidly trusted them because every one had been so friendly. I wonder how many of the people writing positive reviews on got duped out of license and warranty refunds and don't even realize it.

To take orders, you write them down yourself. The menus have a cute design to them. \n\nThis place is EXTREMELY overpriced. We hoped that the price reflected the quality but it definitely did not. We ordered the mango coconut sticky rice, green tea shaved ice, and the bacon and cheese egg waffle. \n\nMango coconut sticky rice (6.99): For $7 i expected a huge plate but what we got was a small plate with not enough coconut milk. This tasted the best out of all 3 dishes but it would be way more appropriate if it were priced at $5. You can get virtually the same quality and sized dessert at Vietnam Noodle Star in the next plaza for 3.99 lol. \n\nGreen tea shaved ice (6.99): Once again, not worth the price as the portion paled in comparison to other shaved ice places such as chamecha or Zen q. How cheap can this place be?? I ordered flavoured ICE. Didn't even really taste the green tea flavour. So disappointing. \n\nBacon and cheese egg waffle (7.99): This was handsdown the worst dish out of all 3. I paid $8 for a plain egg waffle with a handful of soggy bacon and string cheese on it... So many regrets ordering this. Did not taste great.\n\nThe service sucked, it was really slow even though all they have to do is serve dishes. We didn't even get waters until halfway through when we asked for them. To compensate for waiting around 30mins for our dishes they gave us a 10% off coupon for a future visit which I'm never going to use because that night was the first and last time I'd come to this poor excuse of a dessert place. \n\nI don't know about you but I hate getting ripped off so friendly warning: there are way better dessert places so don't even bother with this one.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "It needs a renovation desperately.

In the past we were very happy with Oksana. We were giving Arturo a chance by letting him know our cut preference this last year or so. This last visit I picked him up and as usual picked him up and only noticed the ears being short. Arturo came out of the back room and I stated so. My dog was wearing a long handkerchief around his neck. When we got home that afternoon I took it off as things around his neck bother him for long periods of time and started to notice right away choppy cuts. I examined him fully to now see bald spots in a lot of places including his whole chest and now unveiling bloody cuts through-out his body. At first I noticed his eyes were very watery. I kept a close watch on him. By evening which wasn't very far away at this point his eyes were becoming very goopy so I then went to purchase a saline and watched him overnight. By morning his eyes were crusted shut. I had to get a cool cloth to help open them and we immediately seeked out a clinic nearby. Arizona Animal Wellness Center were able to determine extreme irritations and cuts through-out his body due to bad grooming. They also during this wellness exam did drops in his eyes where under a black light could determine abrasions which 2 were found in his right eye DUE TO CLIPPERS BEING USED OVER HIS EYES AND FACE. I contacted Wiggles and Wags right after this visit to at least see about settling this with me civilly and since Tammy wasn't on site when I showed up I was told she would work this out with me first thing next morning.

The staff is wonderful and friendly as are the members.  The squash offering here is very affordable, but limited.  It is clearly not the mainstay of this club.  The courts are best described as adequate at that time.  The courts were not maintained as I would have liked back in the day.  Often, I grabbed a broom myself and dusted the courts before playing.  The walls were only washed a couple times if that in my tenure there.\n\nThe squash courts were flooded a few years back, due to ongoing roof issues. I cancelled my membership due to the lengthy repair timeline after a flood that turned the two courts into swimming pools.  As a gesture of EXCELLENT SERVICE...which it certainly was...MVRC made arrangements for its squash members to play at Cleveland Racquet Club.  I will always remember my early beginnings of Squash fondly at MVRC.  I have not been back, nor heard anything through the squash grapevine, about the new, repaired courts/ program.  If you are SERIOUS about your squash game, I highly recommend looking into other clubs that are more committed to Squash.  You'll be a better player for it, but you'll be a little more invested in a membership as well.  Like I said, MVRC is very affordable.

But then the rest of the group doesn't show up for another 30 min after typically.  \n\nOn the plus side, I can say I cheaply visited Beijing and Shanghai, although I didn't get to do much of what I wanted to do there.  I hated sitting hours waiting for each shopping stop to be over (and some were overpriced).  The silk factory states they sell authentic brand items, but it's even worse quality than the knock-offs I bought off the street for a fraction of the price.  I'm bitter about my overpriced fake Burberry scarf, but I am as ignorant on what marks to look for as most people.\n\nTwo tour guides.  The Beijing one, \"Rock\", was something.  He does throw tantrums, very controlling, irritable.  Inconsistent.  He got mad at us for 30 minutes for buying from street sellers, claiming he 'cared about' us.  Dude, I've known you 24 hours.  If this was an issue, tell us from the beginning. Sunny was nice and helpful and was willing to give more information on times.  Rock seemed secretive, wouldn't say how long we'd be in a place (probably to make sure we didn't leave).", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "I like that Las Vegas is getting away from the gaudiness but Aria is a little too stark for me.

She asked if I wanted furikake, then proceeded to walk me through the line. After me were two girls completely new to the idea of pok\u00e9.

She was not friendly whatsoever, just gave me a look that said \"It's the sesame shoyu sauce, DUH\". I did not expect so much sauce.

Took the car to the Sahara location and they were able to diagnosis the problem it was a faulty EIS which I replaced and have had no problems since.

We had a terrible experience that we hope nobody has to go through!! The pre op nurses were great and really did a great job at making him feel comfortable and at ease.  We waited for close to two hours to get a room after his surgery but that is not where the problem is.  Once we got a room we were greeted by a nurse that just got us settled in while \"our\" nurse was on lunch.  She explained how they wanted to keep track of bathroom breaks and eating and got us an Xbox list.  We were then greeted by Kate who was our actual nurse.  She told us the exact opposite of what the previous nurse had told us.  She didn't care to keep track of bathroom (besides the first time) or eating ... Weird, but I said ok.  She never once asked my son his pain level or how he was feeling!  She never took his vitals! She never asked if he peed or ate! She was with us from 2-8 and we saw her a total of three times (once to introduce herself, to help with the Xbox which she didn't know how to work, and once to come in cause I called about my sons iv because it was really bothering him).  As I was laying with my son trying to comfort him something started beeping so I called down to her and she proceeded to ask me to get up from taking care of my son to check if everything was plugged into the wall and if not if I could plug it in!!! I told her I will check but you still need to come down here!!  I discovered the iv stand was low on battery so I plugged it into the wall.  Surprise surprise she never came!! I called her again at 6pm to tell her to tell our doc we want to leave.  She said she would call him and tell him and thought it wouldn't be a problem.  Eight o clock at night rolled around and two graveyard nurses (Patrick and Tammy) came to introduce themselves.  They take his vitals and spend time asking him how is body is feeling by showing him pictures of different faces that describe feeling.  At this point I am furious and ask the nurses why I was never told if we could leave or not before Kate left?!  They were both so nice and immediately went to find out what was going on.  Needless to say Kate had called my sons doc and told him we wanted to spend the night at the hospital!!! Wtf?! Keep in mind our doc had told us if we wanted to leave early just give him a call!!  At this point my son is crying cause he wants to sleep in his own bed.  Thankfully the lead graveyard nurse (can't remember her name) was able to get a hold of my sons doctor at 9pm and we were released at 12am!! I was able to file a complaint on Kate and hope that she is reprimanded.  Children especially should be given the utmost care and I do not feel like that was given!! I am very grateful for the graveyard staff that fixed the mess from the prior shift but unfortunately I would never want to end up at a hospital (like this) that does not take pride in who they have taking care of their patients!!

My seasonal sorbet and his butter pecan creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e were also disappointing. The textures were off on both. My strawberry sorbet had that icy crunch, as if freezer burnt. My husband, a connoisseur of creme br\u00fbl\u00e9e, said the only thing it had going for it was the temperature and flavor combination. He likened the thick, burnt sugar crust to a ceramic tile and said the amount of pecans completely overwhelmed the dish.

My husband and I went in to lease a new Chevy Traverse. Initial meeting went well and we were able to reach a payment that was aligned with our budget. We filled out paperwork and were told everything looks great and left with our new car. Shortly after, we received calls stating the finance department needed more information, totally get it as banks usually ask for additional resources when doing a loan. We worked with Santos and sent in the requested paperwork. We then went to the site itself and filled out paperwork a second time. During this second process, we found that the price of our car completely changed and we were not notified. The gentleman helping us claimed it was because of an error that put a different loan percentage at the start of the process and claimed it had nothing to do with our credit as we both have decent credit and make well over the cost of the car per month. While there, the gentleman we worked with was apologetic and said we should have been notified of the change in price but that there was nothing he could do. My husband and I decided to continue to move forward with the car, as it was only $100 difference and we were able to manage that cost. We signed the paperwork and left with the impression that we were finally done with the financing process. Fast-forward two days later my husband and I begin receiving calls and text messages from random people claiming they need more information. I will note, we both work full time and played phone tag quite a bit during this timeframe. We proceeded to explain that we would send the information to them and asked for contact information but that we would not send personal data via text message. I then made another call back asking if I could speak with someone to find out who we should be sending the documents. I was able to speak with someone who said I should receive a call back. My husband and I both work, so when they called back I was unable to answer.  I received a voicemail from a gentleman claiming that I can call him back at his direct line to get the information to him. Upon returning his voicemail, and repeating what was said on the voicemail, he claimed that he never left a voicemail and I was then yelled at and told that they don't even have record of my account on file. I began to share how disappointed I was in this process and that I was just trying to give the documents they requested and the gentleman was not helpful. I then shared I would just drive back over a third time to drop off the necessary documents. This is completely unprofessional and was not the first time that a man yelled at me on the phone from this location. Thankfully, I finally got in touch with a woman who actually provided information and I was given two emails to send the documents. She and Anthony were the only ones who provided any help during this lengthy process. Again, I am not upset about the required documents, I am upset with the way we were treated by this location. I'm very saddened by this entire experience as we were purchasing a car for our first baby as we just found out we are expecting, and this has tainted the process.

The sauce is a blend of sesame paste, hot chili oil, green onions, cilantro and small amounts of vegetables that you mix your dry noodles into to coat them. \n\nI ordered the beef dry noodles and hubby ordered the chicken dry noodles. I found my beef slices to be somewhat dry in consistency. The chicken looked less dry as it consisted of pieces of dark meat.

I would have appreciated something like pickled vegetables to have on the side, but perhaps that is not in keeping with the regional cuisine.\n\nThe level of spice can be customized. Be warned that if you have a low tolerance to spice like me, you may be best to go with no spice! My mouth was burning as I ate most of my bowl of \"mild\" dry noodles!

The next day there crew shows up to make the repairs and again they do a shoddy job .so I do the repairs myself and it passes inspection. Tuff shed comes back to finish the job. 2 weeks latter I get a email requesting payment . I informed the salesman that a final inspection has not been done. The next day the salesman calls me and tells me to call for a final inspection So I informed him that's what I paid him to do. Tuff sheds customer service was terrible .  I will never do business with them again. They may be ok for sheds but as far as a garage I would not recommend. Oh I also gave them a bad survey leaving my contact info in case some one wanted to discuss the service I received and nobody called. I guess corporate is ok with this type of customer service.

Getting your food takes a while since everything is made to order. The staff is friendly and I think they do their best to try to get your order out as soon as possible. I usually get a Fatburger with mayo, onions, and cheese. The meat is well seasoned and juicy. If you do get the chili cheese fries, you have the option with going for fat fries ( thicker cut fries ) or skinny fries ( thinner cut fries ). I personally like it with the skinny fries because more chilli cheese goodness gets in between the nook and crannies.

Everyone who works at the shop was very nice, but I think I was played when it comes to the cost of the repairs and the time it took to make the repairs. I decided to post this because I feel like other customers might benefit from hearing about my experience.\n\nDon't DI Auto Repair told me my repairs would take a few hours, then four days...eventually I got my car back after 15 days. They never called me with status updates (even when they told me they would), I had to call them. I even sat in their shop the day they said it'd be ready (for five hours) and was appalled to hear them on the phone ordering parts for my car that they knew I needed more than a week prior. They gave me back my car with trash and spare parts in the front seat, and a dead battery. And despite replacing the radiator, not even a month later, the radiator hose needed to be replaced.\n\nHere is what happened to my car:\n\nI had a 2000 Chevy Blazer. One evening I was driving home and I heard something pop. I thought it was another car blowing a tire, but I got home and heard a sound like something was frying under the hood of my car. I had my car towed to their shop Monday morning (I used my insurance company's free towing service) because the next day I was flying to DC for a business trip and I figured it was a blown gasket and would take several days to repair. A few hours later I received a call from the shop, explaining that a hose had blown and something about a thermostat censor and the cost of parts and labor would be about $600 and my car would be ready that afternoon. I told them to go forward with the repairs.\n\nA few hours later, I get another call and now I have a blown gasket and a rusted radiator and the repairs will take four days and the new cost is $1600. I protested the radiator because I just got a new radiator not even two years ago. I was accused of putting water in the radiator, causing it to rust, but I don't even know how to do that. I can't even refill  my washer fluid because I'm too short to reach that far under the hood. I was told I wasn't being charged anymore for labor, just the extra parts. I needed my car back, and I was in no position to buy a new one, and I know blown gaskets are usually $2500 minimum to repair, so I told them to proceed.\n\nI eventually got my car back after 15 days (eight days after they originally said it'd be ready) and the bill was $1600 like originally promised so I paid. My passenger seat had a plastic bag on it that I guess was supposed to protect from stains from the mechanics, but there was still a palm-sized black grease smudge on the seat and a metal part sitting in my passenger seat. Who knows what that was from or if I still need it. There was also a bag with a Subway wrapper and an empty soda bottle, someone had lunch in my car.\n\nI didn't notice until i got home (it was Christmas Eve and I wanted to get out of there) but I had some weird charges on my bill:\n$225 work requested machine work - what is that?\noil filter and oil, although I was told I needed to bring it back for an oil change\n$54.58 \"discount\" on what and for what, I have no idea\nThe day I sat in the lobby for five hours I was told I needed another $200 part, but it would be free because of the hassle. It's not listed on my bill at all, not even to indicate the discount.\nAlso, I bought a Yelp deal which theoretically should have lowered the cost, but it seems as though they just added an extra charge to balance it out.\n\nThe shop manager offered to give me a free oil change because I had to wait so long for my car. Which annoyed me because according to my bill I was already charged for an oil change.\n\nShortly after getting my car back it was struggling to start, the heater wasn't working, and when I slowed down or hit a bump, you can hear something rattling under my hood. I brought it back and was told the battery was dead. Also because I had posted pictures of my trashed front seat on Yelp, they offered to clean up my front seat and have my car detailed [they also called and messaged me about posting my pictures on Yelp, which is another reason why I hesitated to post this review]. Since they were charging me $100+ to replace a dead battery (that died because my car was sitting in their shop for more than 2 weeks) I just wanted to get away from there.\n\nAlmost a month later smoke was coming from under my hood and it was overheating. Had the car towed to their shop and was told the radiator hose was blown. That made me furious because they just replaced my radiator, wouldn't they have seen a faulty hose? I'm out another $100+.\n\nThen I'm told I should just get a new car because the next time I bring it to them they'll probably have to replace the engine. \n\nI wish I had taken their advice when my car first blew its gasket, instead I feel like I threw away $2,000; money I could have invested in a new car, which I did eventually end up buyi", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "Would definitely not recommend this place, nor will I be going back!

Even self parking is 10 dollars,  so all this would have been fine due to these poor casinos all hurting for money. What really is upsetting,  is that I arrived at 11 pm\nAnd went to park my car at the self parking to avoid the 18 dollars valet parking charge , and when I checked out they charged me for 2 days although I picked up the car at 5pm the next day so the total hours were below 1 day 24 hours , it was 19 hours only.  The desk gal and the Manager told me to go talk with the valet people. ..are you serious,  I have to catch a flight people and we just spent millions of dollars that equalled lots of revenues and gross to your outrageous everything you serve and provide to rip off people.  I just asked to remove 18 dollars from my huge 1,800. 2 days stay bill ,otherwise you will get a bad review.  Even if I was in the wrong ,which I was not , they should please and satisfy a client. \nApparently they could care less about how I feel so this 0 stars is what you  deserve,  All MGM properties and Casinos are  charging fees now a days,  so would negotiate that when you do your reservations and there are no more coffee making machines in the rooms.  As a matter of fact just stay at Ceasars Casino Hotels,  they actually care about customers and classy treatment all the way. Or like some of my friends comments stay downtown it's great .", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "The brunch plates were big and beautiful but we experienced very poor service (part of our meal was forgotten and our food arrived lukewarm).

They offer specials during their brunch on Saturday & Sunday from 11 AM - 3 PM.\n\nThe arancini were so good we ordered them again!  LIttle balls of risotto, marscapone, and mushrooms served with a white truffle aioli...mmmmm....\n\nWe also tried the bbq pork sliders, very good as well, American fries, and the heirloom tomato salad.  The salad was another hit!  Fresh burrata, arugala pesto and a sweet, rich balsamic.  Very refreshing.  The fries were a really nice surprise!  They are served in a cone and seasoned with shallots and herbs, and then served with two sauces:  a sherry aioli & a spice ketchup.  Yowza!\n\nAnd the drinks, you might ask?  That's why I've been wanting to try this place.  I started with a pear winetini, a refreshing, slightly sweet (not cloying sweet) mix of prosecco, pear vodka, and st. germaine.  I also tried a flight of red wines from Italy - very nice assortment.\n\nThey have Happy Hour specials as well, so I'm thinking there's more arancini & wine in my future.", "stars": 5.0}, {"text": "Instead of the owner calling customers to Ream them out for threatening to post a negative yelp review maybe you think about selling the bar to me so it can be successful!", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "Honestly I love burrito boys ! I go to the port credit one, and the dundas location and its a great and wonderful customer experience. But there is just something wrong at winston churchill. I think its some of the staff. Ive been there 5 times , i've had to correct the order in the bag 3 out of 5 times for takeout. because they almost always short you what you pay for..... once it was the box of chips,once a quesadia, this time a burrito.  \n\nWhen you only have 3 items for order and you get it wrong 60% of the time. There's really something wrong. \n\nI mean its not even miscommunication , like for example, \" I didnt hear you say no cilatntro, or no heat\"\n\nThis is \"I'm charging you for it and not putting it in your take out bag\".....thats a whole other level of lacking.

This machine had no built in thermometer, so there was no setting a temperature, which was a drag. Coming back from EDC having it be hot, then sleeping and having to wake up to turn it off. This was a non-stop problem. Either way, I got through it.\n\nThe bed is surprisingly comfortable to me.\n\nThere is no fridge OR wi-fi..... which... is very sad to me. The room itself wasn't terrible or anything, but nothing amazing as well.\n\nIf possible, I would stay on a hotel ON the strip, just because of the experience, but I wouldn't say Excalibur is bad. For a hotel on the older side with not much remodeling, it was not a totally bad experience.", "stars": 3.0}]
