After communicating with Ori and agreeing on a price we set a trial date and made a partial payment of almost half what we thought we would owe. Then after finishing the trial run of hair and makeup (which was a subpar job in my opinion) Ori proceeded to tell my fianc\u00e9 that the final cost would be almost double what she had quoted! Which made us mad of course, but since we had already paid a large portion of it we just let it go. But then after going home a few hours later Ori proceeded to call us and say she had still under quoted us and raised the price again and needed us to come back and make another payment. How you can run a business cheating customers and more than double the price agreed on after payments have been made is beyond me, nor do I understand how sp salon can endorse such an associate.

Because there is no competition, service, value, and efficiency are not of concern. Because consumers have no other choice, these firms will supply a good or service at a high price that otherwise would not meet the equilibrium between supply and demand. Gun range(s) in Calgary are an example of this type of industry.\n\n$40 gets you 'day pass' in which you get a supervisor and unlimited use of firearms. Seems decent. However, you may only use range ammo, so you're looking at $100 total if you want to pop a few rounds on a few different guns. I'll be honest, the range officers are good guys, not too intimidating, and they love their job.\n\nHowever, I possess a PAL and 9mil handgun. If I want to go shooting with 9mil ammo, I have the option of two outdoor ranges (located at either Dead Man Flats or a block from the ATC tower at the airport) or the only indoor range appropriate for my ammo, The Shooting Edge. Despite the fact that I don't need supervision and I won't use their guns, I am still dinged $40. If I want to take a friend or the woman, I'm now paying $80. The other option is to pay $500/year with $400/renewal. Best of all, if I don't happen to renew for a few months, they won't waive the initiation fee. This is a cash grab, nothing else. \n\nAs I refused to pay this exorbitant fee, I had to either pay $20/month *just* to store the fucking gun, or move it to my home. According to Canada's sometimes retarded gun laws, I had to be a member of a club in order to be \"compliant\" and therefore be able to move a gun from a gun club to a home. I feel safer, don't you? Like all stupid rules, there are ways to circumvent this one, which is by offering an \"associate membership\" which is nothing more than a piece of paper saying that I belong to the club, valid for one year. Despite the 5 mins of manpower & wallet sized membership card printed on paper, I'm dinged $50. They won't even give me a one-time free use of the range, although they do offer a $15 discount on earplugs (ooooooOOOOOOooooo!) I called the clerk out on this, and his reply was \"costs are going up, the times are changing, man\". I spoke to a manager, curious if he could maybe extend some goodwill to a jaded lifer Calgarian, and, while polite, his reply was \"our costs are going up and that's why we charge this amount.\" Wow.\n\nMy relationship with this place is like the relationship Canadians had with Air Canada in the early 2000s. You may hate a firm, but yet you got no other choice. Therefore, you'll hate it even more. If you are looking for a Calgarian's day out (i.e., spend money because the only things that are free are outside but it's too fucking cold outside), this will be a good way.

I was assured no detail would be overlooked and the transition would be seemless. \n\nUnfortunately, I found out a week ago (Jun 2018.... 4 months until my big day) that my venue was now hosting another event at the same time as my wedding. Not to worry though(Jessie, the new coordinator tells me)...my wedding was now predetermined to start at 4p and we would be gone before the next event started at 6p. However, the next event would be set up while my ceremony and cocktail hour were taking place. Oh! And to top it off, they took the liberty of moving my cocktail hour to their \"rose garden\" location... which is currently over looking new home construction and covered in construction equipment. Talk about being blindsided! If I wanted a drive-thru wedding I would have gone to Vegas. They also had no idea how I would get the pictures I wanted in the courtyard... as there was going to be another event going on while I would be \"trying\" to take my photos. \n\nI was assured by my original wedding coordinator (Samantha) my event would be the ONLY event hosted on my day.... Not true whatsoever! In absolute disbelief I tried to gather my thoughts and found myself sitting in front of 4 Blackstone team members. They were callus and cold. When I showed them the emails aligning with my concerns and promises from Samantha,I had 3 options: a $500.00 discount and accept another event being scheduled, or a refund and loss of my venue. They were so rude and uncaring, I took the refund and I am now 4 months prior to my big day with no wedding venue. To them, this was all just a \"misunderstanding.\" Whatever you do....

But nothing works right at Nobu hotel. \n\nChecked in, promised welcome tea never delivered. Toilet stuck flushing until you jiggle the handle. Dead batteries in the bathroom weight scale (not a bad thing on vacation, but come on...) Calling room service lead to being forwarded to five different people before being instructed to hang up and try again. TV fades heavily dark to bright again. TV controls highly glitchy. Internet service doesn't work much.\n\nWorst thing was we could hear every word of every conversation in the next door room at night. They were talking at a normal level. Hotel must have installed cheap walls during the Nobu remodel. It gets worse when your neighbors watch TV or listen to music when you are trying to sleep. \n\nOn the other less noisy wall I noticed I could see the feet and shadows of the guests in that room under the door connecting the two independent hotel rooms. There is no bottom seal on the door! I expect that in some motels/hotels, but we thought this hotel was supposed to be nice.\n\nAfter check-in, noticed the microfridge was locked. Asked them to unlock when ordering room service. They said the remote switch wasn't working and they would have the room service unlock when food is delivered. When the room service guy arrived 45 mins later, he had not heard about it. He said he would have to go get a key or tool. 15 mins later he came back to unlock it. I could finally drink that $70 300ml sake, but our meal was just about over. Too slow, too late. (The sake was good however :)\n\nWe visit Vegas at least twice a year and don't spend too much time in the hotel room. But in this hotel it was really uncomfortable when we finally decided to go to bed. Beyond the noise problem, the air conditioner pumps a cold parching dry breeze right over your face all night long. When the AC shuts down every now and then it makes a putt putt putt motor noise. On the second night we woke up to occasional stale cigarette smoke smells a few times. We were in a non smoking room so maybe came through the AC or through the crack under the door.\n\nWithout a doubt a lower cost standard room at a generic big casino hotel will give you a better experience than Nobu. I think they cut the budget and scaled back on everything recently. Maybe Nobu just wasn't pulling in profit after the initial opening or something. It has become an awful hotel. I read early reviews that said Nobu gives tooth brushes like hotels in Japan. They don't do this anymore. \n\nNext trip it will be back to the Vegas Four Seasons, our favorite. For the price, a much better hotel with larger and quieter rooms. Also, the Nobu restaurant was nothing special. Kumi in Mandalay Bay hotel has much much better Japanese food with flavors that simply explode with delight in your mouth. Nobu food is good, but nothing special. For the price, you can do much better in Vegas.\n\nDisappointed. Oh, I also forgot to mention there was a messy room cleaning cart parked outside of our room door during the length of our two night stay. Right in front of the door. And dirty rags on the ledge right outside our room window. Not much of a view anyway, but please at least pick up the dirty rags.\n\nNo luxury or comfort here. Look elsewhere.

I like how they maintain the salsa bar and keep it well-stocked. Usually I don't go for the spicy carrots, it's cut way too thick. I'll choose the cucumbers and the mild green sauce, but if you like your food extra spicy then go for the red sauce. \n\nI ordered the #13 Chicken Chimichanga which is serve with Spanish rice, pico de gallo, and refried beans, added a side of french fries, and a horchata. The Chimichanga is a fried burrito topped with a lot of sour cream and very little guacamole. It's mostly filled with shredded chicken. There's small pieces of saut\u00e9ed bell pepper and onions, but the chicken is still lacking flavor.

We had every intention of posting a positive review for our first delivery, but never got the chance as we placed our second order on 3/21/17. Our first experience on 3/9 was pretty good with the exception of the 45 minute delivery wait time. \n\nWe ordered 2 individual dinner boxes at $8.25 each, which includes 1-choice of rice or lo mein noodles,  1-side  dish and 1-choice of entree. My husband ordered the Orange Chicken while I ordered Kung Po Shrimp, which cost $1.00 extra [for shrimp]. China Joe's did not disappoint and made a great first-impression with [their] tasty egg rolls and lo mein noodles. \n\nWe ordered again on 3/21/2017 - this time around I ordered Kung Po Chicken and my husband ordered Teriyaki Chicken. We both ordered the lo mein and added 1 full order of egg rolls to include extra dipping and soy sauce, with an emphasis on \"dont forget to bring chopsticks\".\n\nUnfortunately, our entire meal was a BIG disappointment. The egg rolls were ice cold and \"blah\" tasting - blah, blah, blah... AND the chicken on both entrees was so tough that we had to chew, chew, and keep chewing just to get thru our meals lol. We only ate enough to satisfy \"our hunger pangs\", then threw the rest away in the garbage can -  which meant, NO Chinese leftovers for breakfast or lunch the following day - a total bummer :(. Also, my driver forgot to bring our chopsticks, IS a big part of the dining experience in my opinion. \n\nWe did not bother to call and complain. To be frank, I am growing very tired of the lack of consistency and subpar food when it comes to delivery and takeout dining. We've decided to simply move past this bad experience and continue our quest to find a suitable Chinese restaurant that delivers quality food in our area.\n\nSince our first dining experience with China Joe's was favorable, we gave them 2 stars. As for our 2nd visit, we reluctantly give China Joe's 1 star as the Yelp site does not offer patrons the ability to rate a company at zero stars or below.   \n\n[Post script] -  I just learned that China Joe's uses third-party delivery companies such as GrubHub to deliver its food orders.

Both times I had an appointment. \n\nI setup an appointment last week via their website and Robert replied quickly and we setup a 1pm time for the day I requested. Upon arrival, they had no record of my appointment but seemed okay to work me in. I wasn't offered any water like other's experienced but I knew where it was at from the last time since I was there two hours, and became REAL familiar with the waiting area. I received the wifi password from the woman at the front and I settled in. I honestly thought the last time was a fluke and hoped they could have me in and out since I had some place to be. \n\nLuckily I had my iPad with me this time and was able to browse the internet and generally entertain myself. The waiting area is nice enough though and they have a case full of unlimited cold water and granola bars and other snacks to hold you over. Unfortunately when I got bored, the only thing on the TV was a soap opera...with no remote to turn the channel. Talk about torture. It was about that time that I realized that I had been there an hour and a half!! At 2:30 I walked over to the front and was told my car was done and that it was being washed. Fine. It needed to be washed and since I waited this long, I might as well get it for free (though I'm pretty sure they get their money with a $50 oil change). I sat back down and another 20 minutes go by. I walk up to the front and see my car sitting in the parking lot. I walk out thinking it's ready and realize that it's IN LINE for the car wash. At that point I'm really irritated and tell them that I want my car and to skip the wash. They promptly pull it over and I go into pay. I'm pretty sure they could tell I was irritated and tried to make excuses for the long delay by telling me that I arrived 'around the lunch hour and some people were gone'. Are you kidding me?? Do you have one person working back there? Who's managing this place?! \n\nMy service advisor comes around about that time and gives me my bill and tells me that I'll need new tires on my next visit. Thanks! I explain to him my dissatisfaction and he tells me that the 'car wash area needs some definite improvement'. You think? Because I'd say so! Luckily I had a $10 off coupon from their website but I'm still peeved to pay for dealer services and not get the service that goes along with it. I'm familiar with the car business and their bonuses. You'd think they'd be bending over backwards to get great surveys. I definitely won't be returning to this dealership again.

I've been here in Vegas a few times and though the first time was spectacular each time after I've left disappointed. The menu has been completely changed, missing things, or restricting certain items to certain times. It's incredibly frustrating for the prices. There's very little consistency. Even the items that are on the menu every time I've tried- they have changed dramatically. For example the ahi tuna with shaved foie gras. The first time I tried it right around opening we were treated to amazing big sashimi slices of ahi and THICK shaved pieces of foie gras completely covering the plate. The last time I tried it, the ahi was in tiny cubes a la poke mixed with tomatoes and peppers and the foie gras was grated and only served on a quarter of the plate. Still good but not nearly as decadent and the same price. No consistency.\nThe chicken buns have gone missing on the menu even though they still have fried chicken and all the components to make them. But they apparently make a chicken sand which that they'll only sell at 11pm and after?\nThe winter truffle ramen has gone missing (though I suspect it's a seasonal specialty and I hope that is the case and it returns)\nThe chicken noodle ramen is gone as well. \nRamen (this chefs signature in NYC and the reason people go) now is off the menu and is only available at the bar, late night or by request at dinner which I find incredibly odd- if you serve it, and have no problem serving it why not put it on the menu and instead of making it seem like a nuisance if it's ordered or like you're hiding it from diners.\n But other items such as the branzino, pork burns etc. Have never left the menu and are consistently the same. \n\nThe lack of consistency is frustrating, the change of items and ingredients as well. Especially since there are few substitutions for what they take away (I.e no more chicken noodle ramen so no meat based options for ramen other than pork.)\n\nI love momofuku, and would gladly wait in line In NYC, I keep going in Vegas hoping to be as impressed as I was when it first opened- but it just keeps frustrating me and disappointing me.

It's hard to make fans if you keep offering inconsistency.\nI always know what I'm getting at MILK or Momofuku in NYC. they don't change ingredients of meals that I've ordered before or take away simple classics.

From the outside it looks alright, like a standard La Quinta but the inside is a whole other story. \nPros: Nice staff, although a bit MIA from the front desk area. I had to call back to the back after I had waited a good 5 minutes or so. I understand that it is slow and they are taking a little break, but I was not impressed. They need a bell up at the counter or something. That being said, the two guest agents I encountered were very friendly and personable.

You cannot really tell from the front counter and breakfast area but then you start to make the journey to your room and it all unravels. The elevator floor was dirty, there were scratch marks on the elevator walls where people carved their names or proclamations of love(I never understood WHY people feel the need to do this). La Quinta needs to clean that crap up. I got off on the 5th floor and there was no ice machine up there or vending. You have to go back down to level 1(minor annoyance but I expect more from the brand). The windows looking outside from the hall are DIRTY! Like really dirty. Is it cloudy outside? Nope, the window is just extremely dirty. The room was dated with stained carpet, door frames in need of repair, more dirty windows. There were stains on the towels, and the bathtub was dirty. Ew. I always lay down towels or bring my flip flops to shower so whatever. There was also dried CHOCOLATE on the remote(I was seriously wondering if it was poop at first). Luckily I bring disinfectant wipes everywhere to give things a nice wipe down, but really? Gross. \nThe hotel is near a freeway, which I thought would be an issue but it was fine.

I ate here twice and got the breakfast buffet...... for $26 it was the worst breakfast of my life. And a \"shaved chicken\" sandwich (it was low quality deli meat) for a lunch another day.\n\nAt breakfast they have an omelet area but no one was manning it. Flies were buzzing around the fresh fruit. Foods which were supposed to be crunchy were soggy (bacon) and those which were supposed to be tender (stuffed French toast) were hard and inedible. Food which should have been cold was warm (cottage cheese) and food which should have been hot was lukewarm (potatoes and eggs). Some pastries seemed fresh but others seemed more dry (muffins). \n\nFor lunch I ordered a soup because the sandwich came with no side on the menu. When it arrived it actually had a flavorless jicama slaw. The chicken club had no \"club\" like ingredients (no cheese or bacon etc). It had only two slices of tomato, some lettuce and low quality deli meat instead of anything resembling shaved chicken meat. It was very sad for me because I do not eat deli meats because they're so processed. I felt totally lied to by the menu. It was unpleasant.\n\nThe corn chowder tasted great but I got a small cup in a small bowl and it was $7. Outrageous. Also it said it had chorizo in it but really it was three or four slices of deep fried and rock hard chorizo. \n\nAlso although I was a party of 1, a tip was added to my lunch and it was much higher than what I felt was reasonable since my server never checked on me after my entree was brought, never brought me any more water or tea, etc. I haven't heard of a server tipping themselves for a party of 1. Very odd.\n\nI had food off the pool menu at this resort which was better than these offerings so I can't recommend this restaurant at all. \n\nThe hotel has shuttle services to nearby shopping areas which have restaurants that have great food so I recommend heading there to eat or lounging by the pool instead.\n\nI believe the person in charge of the kitchen should eat a few meals here and pay for them to see if they feel this restaurant is being appropriately maintained.

Although, it could easily have been because I couldn't understand one of them because the grammar was worse than the way the menu was laid out.\n\nThat was perhaps what confused me a great deal.  Sense Modern Japanese is an attempt at bringing the more posh style of Japanese tapas into the uptown area.  Perhaps its the way uptown living works, but it's not easy to run an izakaya uptown.  They score high marks for decor.  I will admit, they've put in a lot of effort to stop that draft from doors opening from freezing the patrons, which is a nice touch.  They've also given it a full redesign so it feels nothing like its previous tenants.  \n\nUnfortunately, that's where things dip a little.  The menu isn't exactly laid out in a way that is easy to understand.  Someone had kindly put up a picture of the menu in the photos section, so you can see for yourself.  \"Meat things\", \"Fish things\", while I understand what it entails, I don't understand what they are trying to serve.  I say that because they have a section full of \"filling things\".  They include noodles, curry beef with rice, and even a poutine.  I want to think that it'll be like tapas, where it's many small dishes, but the pricing of some of the dishes don't feel \"tapas-esque\".  That part, confuses me.  \n\nPerhaps what would work better on their menus (which I'm really hoping is just a work in progress) is some photo representation, and a better laying out of the food.  This is why : it's a great location, they can attract people, but they have to keep people coming back.  They've lacked some very essential things that makes izakaya interesting to begin with.  Izakaya usually has some very basic seafood offerings like takoyaki with some twist by the chef.  These guys lacked takoyaki, or tako wasabi.  \n\nWhile not essential, they also lacked a beef carpaccio, Something that sparked more of a Japanese twist, like a chicken karaage.  However, I was quite surprised to see they had a fried quail, which was done in a sort of karaage style.  That didn't disappoint at all.  Points for that as well.  Unfortunate, the rest of the meal wasn't too mind blowing or spectacular, where the red wine curry beef with rice seemed a bit, interesting, as there wasn't much of a red wine flavour, nor curry flavour, the rice was fantastic, but, it was lacking.  The tonkatsu was a little tasteless, and the poutine with duck breast had soggy fries.  \n\nSo you can see, it's not that they're not trying but it's like they haven't quite found their rhythm yet.  I want to give 2.5 stars, but I just can't help but think I got let down a bit by the lack of much to offer on the menu.  I'm just hoping they can really up the ante a bit to make this more enticing.  It's such a waste of all the effort if they can't translate it into something great.", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "In my previous life in education, I heard so much about changing our ideas--our culture--and I always thought it was so much happy horse shit!

He even told me I could come in on his lunch or as the last appointment at no charge for me separately which was pretty nice. I really thought he cared even though I didn't agree with all of his assessments it didn't matter because my daughter trusted him (she doesn't trust anyone) She is diagnosed with Aspergers among many more things. I tried not to take advantage of the free sessions so I didn't see him very often on my own. As well his schedule is very busy. I endeded up switching insurance companies and they took the new insurance. Well after seeing him at a charged rate that was supposed to go through insurance I got hit with an almost $1000.00 bill.

When I called them they were adamant that I pay them even though I explained that it's covered through my insurance (which they knew) I tried to get them to work with me but they would only tell me I owed them money. Dr bill even tried to get me to come in again paying of course. Well after many back and forth phone calls and me having to wait at my insurance companies office because the woman at Dr Bills office said she had to go to lunch and wouldn't talk to my insurance agent my insurance company had to do an audit because they were telling my insurance agency that I owed less than they billed me for (thank gosh I had the bills they sent me). It was very hard to work with the office and I got so stressed out I hung up on the office lady because she was insisting I pay them when I knew I didn't owe them. I also called them and told them we weren't coming the day I got the outrageous bill and they still charged me a no show fee of $75. I still wanted my daughter to see Dr Bill because she trusted him and this was a BIG deal so when everything got settled and I only owed the no show fee I called to make an appointment and the lady told me she had to talk to Dr Bill first.

Let me start off by saying.....read this review first.\n\nBack in February 2012 , I had the opportunity of purchasing a cute little beetle bug for my daughter.  It's an 2004 with just 93,000 miles on it. It has a few cosmetic issues, which needs some attention and just good ole TLC, but it seems to have been a purchase I should have foregone.  Not so much for the car, but for the service (lack of service).  When the car was purchased, it was a mild evening, cold air appeared to be coming from the vents, but again, it was February, and was not needed for this time of year. This is where the heart of the story lies......\n\nI seemed to do all of my homework, heeded my parents advice, as they have purchased several NEW vehicles here, and decided to make my purchase here for this VW beetle.  Well, after my current experience, I am sure they may have their own doubts of the integrity of this dealership.  I will delve further into detail, as it is important for every customer to know what I have experienced.\n\nAfter 2-3 weeks of having the car, my daughter mentioned that the air did not seem to be that cold.  It was cool in the evening and at night, but not during the day.  The dealership had called to schedule a forgotten inspection (prior to delivery) and to offer a free oil change as a courtesy.  This was a kind gesture, so I took it in for service.  I noticed that the rear turn signals and bulbs kept going out, they replaced it, but less than 2 days later, they were out again.  This is where it goes BAD!  I mention to the service technician that the A/C did not appear to be working since it was purchased.  He stated that he did not have the time or manpower to do any a/c checks as I was only scheduled for a courtesy oil change and an inspection.  When asked if he could just check it out, he stated that he did not have the time.  (as Bill Engvall say's - Here's your sign!)\n\nSo the A/C doesn't work and now they claim that they do not have any intention of fixing or repairing this. ***  Buyer Beware***.  If this was just a hose or small leak, I am sure that it would not be a problem, but it appears that it is rather significant issue and cost approx $1600.00 to fix!  Did I mention that I paid cash for this vehicle, I didn't think so, because that should not even be a factor.  \n\nI have contacted the dealer several times, and finally was offered to have it diagnosed as a courtesy.  This was only after I paid for it to be diagnosed at the VW of South Charlotte.  (FYI - those guys have been very courteous)  They came up with the same conclusion except that it would take them much longer to fix it, and even then, would you trust your car to a group of folks who continue to forgo emails,  and will not return your calls.  The service dept informed me originally that they did not possess the tools or knowledge for VW Beetles and would sub the work out to VW.\n\nSo they refuse to assist with any help, saying that it was sold as is.  When the sales manager tells you that he personally would not buy a car with 93,000 miles, it is hard for me to see how they can sell an item, and not stand behind the product at all!  \n\nSince I found no resolution at the sales level, I went to the top - Sissy Parks.  I must say that if I felt I got the run around with the sales team, it even got worse from here.

South of Temperance scored a long term lease so there's no need to worry that it will be torn down for a condo or office building anytime soon.\nThe upscale Hooters comments here on yelp is a good analogy, which is not a bad thing.\n\nWEDDING:\nI helped a friend with his wedding reception which was held here, and it proved to be a great venue, especially on a weekend where the area is more relaxed and is very quiet from the work crowd. Tom, which I think is the manager of the restaurant was very nice and accomodating in helping with the reception -- a pleasure to work with. The restaurant handled the food for the wedding flawlessly and the dinner was well prepared and tasted good -- I typically find wedding food to be rather mediocre, but not here. The little desserts that they offered was rather lack luster and seemed to be either from frozen or made off-site, no biggie as the star should be the wedding cake.\nThe wait staff, looking hot as always, were attentive, friendly and upbeat. They made sure that water and wine were often replenished.\n\nLUNCH:\nForgo the patio on a windy day. With nearby construction, the downtown wind tunnel effect made for an unpleasant meal outside as dust, dirt and debris is thrown in all directions and the furniture gets a little dirty.\nFood was good. The fish tacos are great and I really like the cobb sandwich -- hard boiled egg inside a grilled panini is a tasty combination.\nService was a tad slow with the hoardes of Bay Street lunch crowd -- best to go for an early or late lunch. \n\nAFTER WORK:\nMy last visit was less than stellar.

I was dressed very sharp in all black (not out of place with the other people there), but the doorman noticed my shoes. I wore a pair of custom designed black and red leather Jack Percells, which didn't look too casual or like running shoes and I always get compliments everywhere I go. Unfortunately the doorman didn't appreciate my progressive style eventhough I arrived with a group of friends who knew this doorman.  He let me in with a warning.\n\nInside the restaurant and patio I did noticed a few people wearing canvas Chuck Taylors and one wearing flip flops amongst the sharp-, tired- and pretensious-looking suit crowd, so the dress code seems rather loose here. Ironically one of the waitresses complimented me on my shoes.\n\nThe place gets really busy after work and you could imagine the bar being packed with thirsty after work patrons. There is a bit of a wait at the bar, but the wait staff are trying their best to keep up with the crowd and applaud them for keeping a good attitude and being appreciative.\n\nOn the way out the doorman told me to wear better shoes next time.

The woman (S.R.) who owns the school and refers to herself as \"The Dean\" of the school openly harasses and discriminates against specific students that she targets after she's received their tuition monies. She purposely attacks them trying to destroy them so they leave her school and she can keep their tuition. She has illegally expelled many students who were so badly beaten down and publicly humiliated by her that they did not fight back and simply moved on which is what she wants, especially if she perceives you to be stronger than her. She is all about power over you and control. If you are funded (second careers, etc.) she maliciously interferes with your funding and tries to have your funding revoked from you by lying to your funder and if she doesn't succeed she continues to publicly humiliate you and threatens expulsion for fabricated issues making herself look like the victim. She does not follow her own policies and procedures as she believes that she is above the law.\nThe teachers are wonderful but they too are stuck in a bad position because they see the victimization that she does to the students but can't speak up to her for fear of losing their jobs. Her own husband who comes into the school regularly and assists in testing and some minor teaching openly tells the students that she's a \"B***h\". \nEven if you ignore her attacks and and are the bigger person treating her with the utmost respect and kindness she will still target and victimize you. If you maintain a 70% + average right to the end of the course and she doesn't like you, she will fail you despite your having successfully passed by her minimum 70% average requirement. She will not send your name to the CMTO for you to write your registrations exams and she will demand further monies from you to repeat her course.\nIt is sad when she has to email the students that she favoured and request for them to write a positive review online for her to hide the truth about her illegal actions. She has even gone to the extreme to have forced an entire class to sign a legal document right before their final exams saying they would not write negative reviews online about her school / her or talk to anyone about it or she will sue them.

When it changed from being a BRE-owned property to the current owners, nearly every aspect of living here went downhill. \n\nHere are some of the most important things you should know prior to renting here: \n\n1.) The water billing is done so that you're essentially a proportionate portion of everyone's use. So even if you're good about conserving water, you'll probably be paying more than you should be. When the new company switched to this billing system, it increased our water bill about $12-17/month, even though we're not using more water.   \n\n2.) You'll pay for gas you may or may not use. The company installed gas grills that are always in use except for during the day and when the pool is about to close. Doesn't matter if you use the barbecues or not; you're paying for them.   \n\n3.) DO NOT RENT HERE IF YOU PLAN TO TRY TO BUY A HOUSE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. The lease notice has to be given 60 days in advance (not 30, as in most places). So if you get don't pre-qualified until after that point, too bad, you're paying for an empty apartment for a month if you do get a house. If you put in notice to be on the safe side and your home sale falls through, I guess you're screwed. They are totally uncompromising and unwilling to work out any kind of accommodation on this, either through pro-rating a couple of weeks or anything.   \n\nAlso, that gas bill I mentioned in #2? Prepare to pay to that until you turn in your keys.   Oddly, this policy does not apply to garage rental (which is a staggering $85/month).  \n\n4.) The billing system is inefficient and tedious. The water bill is lumped in with your rent, but you can't just make one payment online. You have to wait until you get an email from Conservice to find out how much the final balance of your rent will be...and even then, you can't just log in to the apartment's portal and see what the total rent will be; you have to add it in yourself when you set the amount to be withdrawn. Also, the new calculation increased our water bill about $13/month. Oh, and to pay online there's a \"convenience fee\" of $2, ridiculous. We used to pay on a no-hassle auto-debit, now it's  a three-step process.   \n\n5.) Recently, the condensation pan for our air conditioner was dripping a puddle into our master bathroom. We called at around 4:30 p.m. on Friday to report this and were told it was not an emergency (so what is?) and it would be handled Monday. Well, we woke up the following night at 3 a.m. to water literally running down in a stream into the three bowls we had to put down to catch the leak. Called the emergency maintenance number and received a call back from the maintenance technician, who said he'd be there....Monday morning.   Which he was. With a temporary fix, that basically caused the leaking to continue. It wasn't fixed until Wednesday and there is still dripping.   \n\n6.) The \"renovation.\" We looked at the \"renovated\" apartments because they offered to move us into one. Basically, it's a stainless steel version of the cheapest appliances possible and a flimsy, paper sticker that looks like wood plastered over the already-existing cabinetry. There is a new \"granite\" counter top and breakfast bar, but the cabinet facings, not the cabinets, are the only thing replaced. So the cabinets are still cheap press board and very shallow. And forget about being able to put so much as a spatula inside the drawers.   \n\n7.) Maintenance work begins obnoxiously at 6 or 7 a.m. Also, it took over a week to get a new kitchen light and we have been waiting more than two weeks to get a kitchen cabinet fixed, despite putting in a request several weeks ago.\n\nFinally, know that if you move here you will be a cog in a machine and not a person. My husband and I never missed the rent once for three years. When my husband got a new job, the pay schedule meant we would be five days late. We called them ahead of time to let them know, bringing a leave and earnings statement showing when his first paycheck would get deposited. Did they care? Nope. Just had us served, beginning the eviction process, and tacked on $80 of fees.  \n\nI understand they have a corporate process in place, but if your renter is telling you ahead of time they'll miss the rent and hasn't had a problem for three years, maybe some flexibility and customer satisfaction should take precedence.

Again, may be personal taste, but I did not like the taste of the rice at all; totally could be \"real\" Mexican, but didn't dance well with my taste buds.

I guess I'll start with what was good about this place - Josh, our server, was FANTASTIC. He honestly saved the night! My family and I arrived at 8pm, on a Tuesday night, and he was the only server on the floor with a 12 top plus 5 other tables (not including us!). Upon greeting us he immediately apologized for seeming frazzled and still wore a huge smile! The manager clearly cut the floor way too early and it appeared as if she didn't even care - about the diners or the server! She stood around lollygagging instead of asking the server if he needed help with anything. At that point if you don't care about your server you should at least care about the guests and not have them wait 15+ minutes to get something as simple as a glass of wine. The poor guy was slammed! Then out of nowhere she pops up awkwardly and says, \"It's coming I'm promise your food will be here\" and walks away with no chance for us to say or ask anything. Come 8:45 our food still hadn't arrived and Josh came up to us and apologized saying that the kitchen was disorganized and just let him know they were out of salmon... we settled and ordered the Alfredo with chicken for my cousin. Finally 5 min later the food came out and that saved the night as well - I would give that a 4/5. My mushroom ravioli was so tasty, my other cousin loved the Olivia's flatbread and my mom was drooling over her chicken parm minus the mash potatoes (she wanted those instead of pasta) which seemed to be instant ready made nastiness. Unfortunately it starts going down hill again from here... It's now 8:55 (we've only had our food for 5 min and we ordered 30+ min ago) and we ask our server for more bread and he responds, \"Um let me check if I can get you some because I think my kitchen is closing down.\" I'm aware that the restaurant was scheduled to close at 9 but our food took forever to come out and we were never given a last call! You could tell the server was frustrated but still wore a genuine smile through it all. When he brought out the bread it was 9 o'clock on the dot and of course my 11 year old cousin was wanting dessert like most kids. My mom politely asked and followed up with, \"I know your kitchen is closing but would you mind checking for us?\" When he came back his response was, \"Sorry my kitchen said they're too tired but I would be more than happy to get you tiramisu or cannolis because I can do those myself.\" Josh was literally jumping through hoops and bending over backwards for us! We told him we appreciated his kindness but not to worry about it but asked if he could take off the Caesar salad she ordered because she didn't like it (it was very bland as well as her Alfredo). At the very end while waiting for our check the manager came over and said, \"I'm sorry you didn't like your salad\" and our response was, \"Don't worry about it, the rest of the food was great.\" All she said was \"You're so sweet\" and awkwardly walked off again... this lady needs to go! No apologies for the fact the food took so long or that the kitchen closed without giving last call or the fact that everything was such a mess!

I asked for a kids menu for my 13 year old daughter, and he immediately questioned my motives, asking \"just who is this for?\" I explained that my youngest was 14 and special needs and couldn't read such a vast menu with so many choices.....he awkwardly left the table to get our drinks. He then asked to take our order and I had to ask him again to bring a kids menu to the table. We ask if the guacamole is fresh in house. He said yes, and that he recommended it highly , because he just came out here for his night off to have dinner with a friend and that is what he ordered. Okay, then bring it to us.

I looked up clabacitas and noted it had no beans in it (it was supposed to contain corn, zucchini, sweet and poblano peppers). My salad comes with black beans...At first I was not sure if it was my mistake or theirs, so I ask to see the menu. Sure enough, there is no mention of black beans anywhere on the salad description. When I bring this to the attention of our server, he says \"Oh, this is awkward, I hate it when something like this happens. I don't know what to do....\" Then he mumbled off....awkward really is the only word for the service we received. Our bill came for the full amount, and we paid it. As much as I tried to eat around the black beans, the meal still managed to get me sick.\n\nI might go back just to have mumble mouth serve us again. He was so awkwards he was entertaining.

Yes, it was our fault for not making reservation earlier so it was nice of them to still accommodate us. We sat at a table without white table cloth but that shouldn't mean terrible service right? \n\nFirstly, our server didn't look too happy and was totally out of it. We asked for a drink menu so he got it for us alright. He plopped a THICK drink menu and just left. No recommendations, no nothing. When we finally got his attention and asked for recommendations, his response was \"There's a table of contents here.\" When we gave up, we ordered a bottle of house red cabernet sauvignon (which was still 60usd, so not cheap). As for the meal, we made it easy for the server, we each got the valentine menu (90USD, so not cheap again) even though the restaurant still offered their regular menu (which probably cost less too).\n\nWhen the first plate arrived, presentation looked nice. So I was excited because at this point we were so hungry. However, I got excited too early. The food was cold as if it was sitting in the kitchen for awhile. First course, we ordered was the bone marrow. It  was tasteless; not seasoned well. Second course, the best course of all, was the lobster ravioli. This dish was salty but it had fresh chunks of lobster and at least it wasn't soggy. Third course was the medium rare steak. I'm a huge fan of steaks but this steak was so tough and chewy that I lost interest in it. Lastly, is the dessert. It is a trio but only one out of the three was yummy. \n\nBecause the server was so out of it and our friends were in a rush to a show, we didn't say or complain about it.

The first time was in November 2009 for about three months . As a travel nurse I have experienced the good bad and the ugly of large apartment complexes. If this were March 2010 I would probably be giving at least four stars. That probably explains why I chose to move back here with my husband a year ago when we relocated here . So the good is the location . It is walkable to the grocery store and more importantly Starbucks . There is also the wonderful Desert Breeze Park which we love . Short drives will get you to many shopping centers , restaurants and malls . The bad is a longer list. The complex had recently changed management a month before we moved there . Michael , the kind of disorganized but very nice guy who set us up with the apartment was gone within two weeks of our moving in . That set up a trend of revolving door office staff . Cassie is the good here . She has been there all along and truly gets things done and really knows her stuff . CASSIE YOU ARE FIVE STARS ! There was one woman there who would always ask us if we wanted a tour and we would always remind her we were tenants . The most recent new guy in the office does his best to appear to be engaged but he is pretty bored . The maintenance staff was always responsive and fixed things timely . However , replacing broken appliances with repurposed beat up appliances from other units is not really a solution .  Our dryer broke and the replacement had red sharpie marker on the front and a really filthy lint catch . I can clean so I did . the fun came when the dryer began eating our clothing , It left grease marks on a few shirts and ruined four bras (which were not cheap or that old .) Maintenance came timely as usual (thanks guys you are all FIVE STARS too.) and found a belt was loose and pretty well shot . Obviously these things are not maintained preventatively before they are  placed in units . MEB has this marketing campaign calling the work being done to the complex an Extreme Makeover. It is EXTREMELY annoying . There was never a time in the past year that tenants were free of construction . It was the roof when we first moved in . Okay safety first whatever . Then it was the neverending paint project . My apartment was entombed in plastic for a month . I have eyes . I could see the painters slowly set up at maybe 8am if lucky and then take multiple breaks . MEB I hope you dont pay these guys by the hour . I might add the new paint has done nothing for the building's appearence . Ugly uncomfortable patio furniture and a big screen waste of  money TV have been added to the main pool as part the \"ongoing exciting changes \" that the constant constuction memos would boast.  Explain to me how a company can resurface a parking lot and make it look worse .  There is a horrible deep pothole on the way to the pool that I thought for sure would get fixed when the lot was resurfaced . Not so much . Jumping back to the pool area and common areas in general ..............noone watches their kids here . Kids run wild . A memo was placed on everyones doors reminding them of the rules but parents are really lazy here and the office doesnt enforce the rules . In  fact two weeks after moving out we saw six loud , obnoxious kids riding bikes and scooters on sidewalks there while elderly tenants had to jump out of the way . I hope the small children swimming unattended dont drown but the odds are great a tragedy will occur there . Allow me to segway into the class of people moving in . My husband watched to young kids smoking weed while leaned against the building one Saturday .Theres alot of sketchy visitors as well .There is a guy building some kind of electrical box / generator on his patio. It looks a little shady and I wonder if it is even safe . I've never lived in a rental where you are allowed to do that . We left the apartment immaculate and did not receive the full $100 securitry deposit back . Cassie wrote me and told me our final water bill was deducted and they took off a late fee (thats good considering we were never late .). Regarding the water bill we did not receive a bill for the last two months.  we lived there and paid above our rent based on past bills so I still scratch my head that they took $50 away .

If I were to sit next to an infant (not in a car seat) or an adolescent, I'd be just peachy. Sitting next to another dude my size -- not so much. \n\nAlso, the risers where the seats rest are a little unstable in my opinion. Agree with Chad E on that front.

I had been going to Valerie at the Silverado location, but today I went to Corinne here at North Rainbow. BIG MISTAKE! I went because I had a lunch break at work and my brows needed to be waxed. I didn't realize I already had an appointment with Valerie tomorrow. I thought it was next week - coincidentally she left a message while I was getting the worst wax of my life. I will never return to Corinne again.\n\nI got there a little after 12:00 PM, and I was told that the Benefit employee was supposed to be there already. I waited about 10 minutes, and Corinne finally arrived. She told me to wait in the chair because she had to finish her own makeup. She said she dropped her Gimme Brow in the car and couldn't find it. She seemed very upset by this, and she said it was her favorite product. She said one of her brows was unfinished. She looked fine to me. \n\nShe used the Gimme Brow sampler without using a new applicator (she used the one on the sampler). She told me she was late because she had to take her boyfriend to work as his own car was in the shop. Then she got the waxing stuff set up. She appeared to be moving in slow motion, slowly grabbing wooden sticks and cotton-tipped applicators from the storage container. It took her about three attempts to get the wooden sticks out of the container (they weren't packed tightly or anything). It seemed a little off, but I figured she was in no rush as she was apparently late for work. Hindsight is 20/20, and I am now actually worried she was under the influence while performing my service.\n\nI told Corinne that I had been growing my eyebrows for the past 4-5 months, and that Valerie said they had been growing in nicely. I complimented Corinne on her own eyebrows and thought I was in good hands (since I liked her own eyebrows a lot). She never asked me to sign a liability waver, which I recall signing with Valerie every time.\n\nAs she waxed my eyebrows, she kept saying that \"everything I do has a purpose\" and \"don't touch your eyebrows between waxes.\" She said she was \"starting from scratch,\" which gave me pause because I have been going to Valerie for 4-5 months. If I have that much regrowth, why is Corinne making such a big deal out of it? I felt like she was lecturing me about how to maintain my eyebrows. I told her multiple times that I don't do any tweezing between visits, and that I have even bumped up my appointments in the past to accommodate fast growth.\n\nCorinne seemed inexperienced, as her motions were not very fluid. She was very rough with every touch, even when just simply cleaning. It hurt. However, if it looked good in the end, I was willing to deal with some roughness. After all, waxing isn't exactly a pleasurable thing. Unfortunately, my brows look terrible.\n\nTowards the end, I mentioned I had a scar on the right eyebrow. It has never affected the outcome, and I thought it was irrelevant since I was growing out my brows. The scar is only visible when my brows are thinner, and even then it doesn't look bad. Corinne then scolded me and said \"you really need to be telling people that because I could have really messed things up.\" She then told be about a woman with bushy eyebrows and a big, noticeable scar. She lectured me for about 5 minutes. As a professional, she should ask that information if it is THAT important. Again, I didn't volunteer this information because the goal is to be GROWING my brows, not making them thinner. \n\nThis is when I really got the impression that she is young, immature, and inexperienced. Nevertheless, I know there are some high school students out there that tweeze their own eyebrows to perfection. All I cared about was the end result.\n\nShe did at least put on some eyebrow products to make them presentable, but that really would not have been necessary if she had done what I asked in the first place. She used the Gimme Brow sampler on me, which she had previously used on herself.\n\nI paid $20 for the service and left a $5 tip (even when I receive bad service, I have a hard time not leaving a tip), but I was not able to fully evaluate just how bad things were until I got home and removed all of the product she put on my skin and brows.

The front desk agent was very helpful and informative. A nice start to our stay. Rooms are lacking quite a bit compared to their competition, and our room just smelled like Chinese take out. The double rooms are fairly tight and do not offer much room to move around. The tube TV is out dated, the furniture is stained along with the carpet and wallpaper is peeling.  The bathrooms are average sized and offer all the amenities you would expect from a Westin. However, the water pressure for the shower is miserable, and their Heavenly Shower with a double head on it is pointless. I prefer a shower that works properly before they start attaching the bells and whistles on it. The Heavenly Beds are comfortable and the AC works great. Finally, the housekeeping is a joke. The only service they provide is making the bed. Forget about organizing the room or the bathroom. \n\nThe non resort Westin charges a resort fee for things you never or rarely use...like incoming faxes.  It's like an apartment charging you pet rent.  It makes no sense.  They also state that your $11 daily fee gets you \"free\" water.  I can't quite figure that one out.  \n\nA 24 hour Starbucks is in the lobby, so if you're hitting the slots and on a roll at 4am and need to keep going, you can grab your coffee.  The restaurant is 24 hours as well.\n\nOverall, a decent hotel at best. Great location, great friendly staff but the Westin suffers in taking care of the details.  If they are asking for more than $100 a night...keep looking.", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "Highly overrated on yelp. The rolls are too big and they offered very little fish on the rolls.

I had to go get paper towels for his hands... He immediately knew there was a problem and called his boss about it. Before he left I checked the wings and there was a black hair  on the food... needless to say my money was refunded. \n\nI did try the food and the pizza was very salty and greasy even after I set it on paper towels to try and soak it up. I think they should do away with the oil pesto sauce and go with a creamy alfredo or something. The wings came on top of a bed of corn tortilla chips which was different, but since the hair was on the chips I just threw those all away and carefully inspected a wing before trying it. These were fine tasting. \n\nI cannot say enough good things about the delivery boy who was very apologetic and got the issue taken care of right away and my money refunded. The food however...

I had the grilled chicken and my friend had the chicken and waffles.  As you'd expect, both portions were huge.  My grilled chicken had the best flavor out of both dishes and was solid.  Unfortunately, the chicken to vegetable ratio was very off and in 3 bites, I had consumed all the vegetables on my plate.

I've read plenty about this place over the past few years, all the reviews from my fellow Yelpers, and now the Bon Appetit magazine top ten-this must be the best BBQ in Phoenix, I thought to myself.\nFirst thing that strikes you is the chalkboard menus that really don't make a lot of sense so being my first time I studied it for several minutes to see all what they offered.  I was somewhat surprised that they didn't offer combo type plates, but I can always manage to find something to shove in the ol' gullet.  Half a chicken, side of mac & cheese and a drink was just over ten bucks and as others have pointed out CASH ONLY (and there were still dumb people at the counter asking 'does that mean no debit cards??').\nI sat down in the very spartan dining room and thought about what the meal would be like.  I think BBQ is sort of like politics-people are very staunch in their beliefs and anything outside that just plain sucks.  While I certainly try to be open minded, I'm definitely a BBQ-means-the-art-behind-smoking-the-meat kind of gal.  Sauce should be minimal, if at all, but it appears Stacy's has a different interpretation.  There was probably a half a cup of sauce that my chicken was swimming in.  To their credit the sauce was decent and not overly sweet, I believe I tasted a hint of celery which was different.  \nUnfortunately since I arrived just as they opened it sure seemed like I got yesterday's leftovers.  Not that it's a bad thing necessarily, but the patrons should not be able to tell.  The chicken was drenched, likely to try and disguise it was on the dry side, and the mac & cheese had the pool of oil on top which is a tell-tale side of a reheat (anyone who's made their own mac & cheese knows what I mean).\nI'm on the fence as to whether I'll return to Stacy's, it is some of the better I've had in Phoenix but not great at least in my humble opinion.", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "Made a account just to right this review and I wish there was a 0 I could give.

Having been to several fusion restaurants some of the flavors overlap and the intent is lost due to the fact that I get the impression that the chef's are jacks of all trades and masters of none. This was definitely not the case here. The food was outstanding. Fantastic tacos and our group shared several of the rice dishes. We started with the edamame and the rocky shrimp. Usually rocky shrimp is not very good but having had it once where it was outstanding I try it every time I eat a place for the first time that features it on the menu. It was really good. I have to say the thing that was most impressive was the Oaxaca Old Fashioned.  The bartender who made this drink achieved perfection. Literally this was one of the best cocktails I have ever had. The only draw back was that our service was pretty horrendous. Maybe because I was seated on the patio with my group. I noticed the servers inside seemed much more attentive. We waited quite awhile to order the drinks and appetizers. Then there was quite a bit of time where our glasses were empty and we waited to order our meal. Maybe my frustration was expounded due to the fact I really wanted more of the aforementioned cocktail.

Terminex, Orkin, and House Doctors.\n\nFirst to show, House Doctors!  A gentleman named Chas showed up and walked through the entire home checking out termites.  The one bedroom is the only room that showed an active sign and his plan of attack was Termidor around the entire perimeter of the house.  He provided a price for a two and five year warranty and went on his way, no pressure at all.  \n\nNext to show was Terminex.  A gentleman named Joe showed up, much more professional than house doctors with his uniform, shoe covers, truck and all.  He walked around the whole house as-well and his treatment plan was Termidor ONLY in the area showing current activity, and then he would place bait stations around the perimeter around the house.  You think that would be cheaper?  Wrong.  Terminex rang up right at 2 grand after a 10% discount for a 5 year warranty.  Joe did not pressure me that hard however he did attempt to close the sale and said they could get started same day.  \n\nLastly, Orkin showed professional as well.

Since it was the Cleveland Brown's final preseason game, thought we would eat out and watch the game. Sadly I tried to play some pre-game music on the jukebox, but the volume was much lower than the radio. Upon asking the server if it could be turned up, the response of the manager at the time is it is already loud enough. When I asked if the songs could be skipped so music could be played, she indicated she had a full bar and could not do it. But she went further, and included our discussion to everyone at her full bar. The song playing went for 20+ minutes, she could not find the time to hit the eject button, but found the time to run her mouth to everyone sitting at the bar. I had a few guys ask me how much I paid so they could refund me the money from their own pockets. It wasn't about the money....it was about tailgating.....And while one might think this is a personal conflict with me and her, I never meet her and don't even know her name.

DO NOT USE AT ALL COSTS.  My sales rep Scarlet was very nice and pleasant up front, I had all of my belongings in storage and I needed them shipped cross country by a certain date as myself, my wife and my infant son (3 months) were relocating to the Northeast.  I called in mid May and told her I needed the items in Massachusetts by 6/29/15, I did not care when they were picked up.  She said that a pick up date of 6/15 would leave plenty of time and guaranteed a delivery window of 3-14 days.  After placing a deposit and reading the contract thoroughly I noted in there that the delivery window stated it could take up to 21 business days which would put my items for delivery well into July.  Since this would make the delivery time unacceptable I sent an e-mail to Scarlet addressing my concern  and letting her know I would need to find another carrier.  Scarlet did not respond to my e-mail but immediately called me (HUGE RED FLAG when sales people call instead of responding to email) and she stated that it was just standard language from whatever government agency oversees the shipping industry and that my specific estimate will be my delivery window.\n\nThe movers arrived on 6/15 as scheduled and loaded everything, and off my stuff went, I thought to Massachusetts.  I followed up with Scarlett after a week of not hearing anything and she stated my stuff had been put on a truck and was headed to Boston (I thought that was done when my stuff was picked up at my house...) and should arrive for delivery 6/26 or 6/29.  Again after hearing nothing I called for more information and this time Scarlet was no where to be found and I spoke with someone in operations that told me my items were sitting in their warehouse in Phoenix and had never been put on a truck for delivery to the East Coast.  \n\nNeedless to say I was irate, me, my wife and my 11 week old son were now stranded in a new city with an empty house. No bed, no crib, no chairs, not even blankets to sit on the floor.  I had to incur the cost of a week stay in a hotel, baby essentials and visit the laundry mat so my family had enough clean clothes to last until our shipment arrived.  \n\nAdam with Eli relocation took one of my calls and assured me he would adjust my contract if he had to and to let him see what happened and make sure my shipment got to Massachusetts as soon as possible.  After that initial conversation with him he did not respond to any of my voice mails and has not yet done anything he promised regarding my contract price.  Also I have tried to reach Scarlet, my sales rep, who also has gone silent and not returning any calls.\n\nWhen my stuff finally arrived a week late, many of the boxes and heavy duty storage tubs had been crushed and the contents broken.  One dining room chair was completely destroyed to the point I am embarrassed for the laborer that had to bring it into my house.\n\nI understand things go awry and stuff happens, all I ask for is someone to stay accountable, apologize if it is their fault, and return my calls as promised.

Roast beef was average, but the chef that manned the carving station is a total sweetheart!  Shrimp and grits was, well, shrimp and grits.  The pulled pork sliders were better than I expected.  Didn't try the mini hotdogs.  Didn't try the cold fried chicken.  No king crab legs.  Didn't even go near the Asian section as the dishes looked stale, you know that dull-dry-sauce-look on foods?

Everything else was great - food wise - however the rice of the sushi was dry and the seaweed was chewy. If you have sushi in your name, that should be a carnal sin and something you should be aware of. Again, maybe they were having an off day! I'm willing to give them the benefit of the doubt due to their other food which satisfied us. The scallops were cooked to perfection - a feat not very many AYCE sushi places seem to get right. Beautifully crisp outside and soft inside. The gyoza was also delicious, and the gyoza sauce too. Above it all, their grilled bean sprouts! Oh my. You must, you must, you absolutely must try the grilled bean sprouts. We had 3 plates of them! Delicious, warm and not heavy at all. I genuinely debated asking to pay them extra if I could take a box of their grilled sprouts home but I didn't want to look greedy! \n\nThe price for their dinner menu is also very affordable, under $20, which is great as not many AYCE sushi places are that affordable. I will say though that the interior was extremely confusing when we walked in. The pillars, the windows and the brick made us think we had walked in to an Italian restaurant slash pizzeria and we were thrown off guard for a second until we looked around and saw some of the accent decors thrown in indicating it is indeed a sushi place. There's a cute little private fresh sushi bar towards the back. \n\nI would give it 3 stars but unfortunately, we were physically uncomfortable the entirety of the hour and half we spent there. The seating! My ass hurts just thinking about it. The tables seemed too far away from the chairs so you had to lean over and sit at the edge of the seats to eat, leaving us crouched for far too long and needing to stretch occasionally. It didn't help that the benches we sat on weren't padded and extremely hard. Thinking of having dinner sitting on your high school bleachers. Definitely stop by for the sprouts and the food if you're in the area, however, I wouldn't again go out of my way to come here as the seating was a huge factor in leaving a distaste for the place in my mouth.", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "The ham egg and cheese sandwich was okay.

There were only two BBQ sauces and one was an Asian-oriented sauce unusual for this food and the other was at best like a slug of molasses.  \n\nHowever, a dining experience is more than the food even if the setting is a casual environment.  The attitude toward the customer starts with the owner/manager and the staff essentially follow it.  My order came back wrong.  The server did correct the problem when I pointed it out.  At the end of the meal, the server inquired about my interest in desert.  Since it was my first experience there and my initial order came back wrong, I inquired if management would cover the cost of desert as a gesture of service courtesy.  The server went to the owner/manager who didn't both to come over and talk with me and said they would give me only half a desert but charge me half the price. This approach obviously won't win any loyalty from me nor likely from anyone else.

Wrong....apparently the place still has the newness factor and I drove around 10 minutes trying to find a parking space   I tried the valet parking across the street but they were full and I ended up driving around before settling on a space 3 blocks away.\n\nThankfully there were a couple of seats at the bar which I claimed one.  Looking around the place, I felt really old here. The place seems to cater to the younger crowd even at 8pm.  \n\nThe bar was busy. It was about 10 minutes before someone even acknowledged me.  Then I asked what their beers were and she explained them (little did I know that the menu she would hand me in a few minutes would contain a list of their beers).  Thankfully they have a bunch of craft beers on tap.  \n\nThe food menu is small and consists of apps (think chips with salsa, queso or guac), salads, tacos and such but your choices are limited for all of them.\n\nI went with the recommendation from another review of the queso with everything except chorizo for an app and 2 tacos rojas which were all vegetarian.  Another disappointment when both arrived at the same time.  The queso was mediocre at best.  It was very grainy and the extras of black beans and jalapenos were on top of a cheese crust rather than mixed in the queso.\n\nThe tacos were decent but nothing i would consider better than average.\n\nService is what caused this to be a 2 star review rather than a 3. Although there were 3 bartenders, only one seemed to be 'my' bartender but she disappeared and I didn't see her after one \"Are you ok here\".   Another bartender asked me if I wanted another beer but that was it...at that point I was ready to close my bill.  The 3rd one asked again if I needed another beer and I stated I was done and finally I received a check. Unfortunately at the time it was too late to make up for the other mistakes.\n\nSo if you like trendy places in trendy neighborhoods with limited parking, perhaps you would enjoy this one.

Eat immediately? Something for everyone? A\nchocolate fountain bonus? Yes please! \n\nThe rolls are fine and fresh here. Some of the nigiri is better than others.  But buffet wise - solid.

I train about 6 days a week and cycle through a few different gyms depending upon my needs. I travel quite a bit and have subs to Golds, LA Fitness and 24 Hours Super Sport. In the past I have worked as a personal trainer and am an Army vet whose MOS required a high level of physical ability. I perform a lot of proprioception (balance/stability) type routines mixed in with range of motion exercises and strength training. \n\nIn my professional opinion the big pro of this gym is Kyle the trainer. In all my years both personally and professionally he is without a doubt the best trainer I have ever seen. Its not just his knowledge which is extensive, but the manner in which he interacts with his clients. This is a guy who is more than just passionate about what he does, he is a living example. He coaches, corrects and congratulates. I do not know Kyle personally, except in passing and watching him at work, but I have a great respect for him and only wish I could afford to hire him myself. I have worked with hundreds of trainers in my past including elite military trainers, some of whom are still my friends, and without any doubt I would still rate Kyle as the best.  \n\nIn terms of the gym itself it is actually fairly small when compared to almost every other 24 hour gym in town, except for the one that is downtown. I am often hard pressed to find the space I need to train on a bosu or stability ball which I use extensively throughout my workout. They have a dance/aerobic room upstairs but its not really convenient to keep running up the stairs between sets. As well, the mens locker room is pretty small and can get very cramped during peak hours. Amazingly I have never had a problem finding a free locker. \n\nIn the last year or so the gym has really suffered in terms of cleanliness and the overall state of the equipment. The mens bathroom is horrendous during the daytime hours and they even took out the paper towel dispenser some months ago. This is also the one gym where I rarely see any of the staff make an effort to help put away weights or equipment even during the late evening hours. As with most gyms people seem to grow tired or lazy when it comes to re-racking their weights and the whole place becomes its own obstacle course. \n\nOn the positive side (for me anyways) this location has a pretty hardcore clientele. When Golds gym on sandhil closed this was my go-to gym for hardcore motivation. It's nothing like seeing Cutler, Wolf or Burneike workout at Golds/Sandhill but there are a lot of elite people here and quite a few vets. \n\nThe biggest negative for me at this gym is the management, namely Martin the GM. A few years ago when I started here the staff was incredibly friendly. The manager at the time would even come out to say hello and meet people. This recent manager is rude, unfriendly and dismissive. Of all my friends who work out here, not one has anything positive to stay about him and in fact all my interactions have been very negative. I have 2 friends specifically who have left this gym because of his mistreatment. The good news is that ever since Martin showed up the gym has in my opinion gotten less crowded during the day time when I am usually there. Of course it could just be coincidence or me getting less attentive as I age, but I won't dismiss the obvious either. \n\nAnother negative for me is they actually recently hired a trainer, who might even be the training manager now who has tatoos on his calfs that read \" Cheaters always WIN\" and \"Winners always Cheat\". This to me is the very antithesis of my own personal journey.  I am sure he thought it was funny at the time or perhaps it played to some whimsical sentiment but it seems completely contrary to the whole idea of hiring a trainer in the first place.   \n\nIf you are looking for some hardcore customers to stay motivated and the best trainer in Kyle, this gym is a great option. However, be prepared to overlook the poor management and less than perfect facilities.\n\nUpdate: Added a 4th star. This location has a new manager who is a huge improvement.

Tasty enough, but only 4 small pieces and some olive oil/balsamic/pepper mix.\nThen we had:\nWarm Mediterranean Olives - Plenty given, tasted like grocery store ones\nSmoked Salmon - 3 fair sized pieces with bread and capers.  Tasty\nTrio of Seared Jumbo Scallops (uploaded picture) - Very tasty, but not so jumbo\nAlbacore Tuna Crudo - Not bad, but we weren't impressed.

The 2 stars represents the wonderful atmosphere, the preserved history AND how wonderful the very famous Balzac's is in the greater scheme of the entire Distillery District. \n\nThere are a couple of points if like to discuss briefly , or to mention. First, I have no idea WHY this beautiful building, especially as locals and tourists alone are there to use there cameras in this great Victorian industry, that NO PHOTOS ARE PERMITTED . \n\nThe only other places where you really should not take photos is a gallery - that makes sense, they I can appreciate . But for The most illogical and bizarre reason(s), taking PHOTOGRAPHS IN THIS PUBLIC space is a definite no, no. I literally have no idea why you cannot take photographs inside what is essentially nothing more than a coffee shop. I would LOVE to find out the rationale, even though I have seen countless people thinking to themselves, \"why can't I photograph this beautiful Victorian space, the architecture, the original fixtures, the beautiful staircase among all kinds of wonderful and interesting items designed for it TO be seen , and take photos regardless. \n\nSecond, the coffee is exceptionally tar-sands thick and tasteless no matter how much sugar you add to a coffee. Don't get me wrong, you are in the Distillery and prices are higher, so let's understand that. But in talking with other visitors,there has at times been agreements that McDonalds or Tim Hortons has far far better coffee. I'm not sure if this is a very traditional way of roasting coffee, which if it is, I can understand. It may be me, but I've heard other visitors with the same opinion. Anyways. \n\nRest assured, it's a definite stop in the Distillery for its own sake. Again, and I've seen employees SAY BLUNTLY to tourists, no cameras are allowed to their utter confusion of people from other parts outside of Toronto visiting. What is this place, the Vatican Archives? \n\nSo be aware of that, pictures are taken by so many individuals because of its rustic beauty. Why else do you think that people want to come to the Distillery? Something you could always ask if you are forced to put your travellers' cameras away. \n\nPrices are generally higher but still I would recommend a visit to Balzac's just to sit back in the sun on the patio and watch the world go by.

I've been to AZ Wilderness a few times now to check out the \"Nation's Best Brewery\" just down the street from me. And you can tell they work hard for this honor. And with the service I've gotten there each time, the constant rotating brews, and the awesome cabin style atmosphere, I can definitely say they have earned it.\n\nThe food is the typical brewery fare with a few twists. The burgers and tacos I've had have been okay but nothing mind blowing. The duck fat fries are a pleasant twist to traditional fries that are very enjoyable and the waffle battered onion rings are awesome. But, being a brewery, the food isn't usually my main focus.\n\nMy reasoning behind my rating is more because of my own personal taste in brews. We all have our preferences and I'm no different. My biggest turn off with beer is when they have a rough Hops aftertaste. This is the main reason that I just can't drink most IPAs, no matter how many I try. I'm definitely more of an Amber or Wheat beer drinker myself.\n\nMost of the beers I've had at AZW sadly have enough of this aftertaste to them that I have a hard time enjoying them. I can't stomach their flagship IPA Refuge and every time we've gone, the beer rotation has been heavy on Pale Ales, IPAs,  Saisons, and other hoppy beers. I have tried a few of their seasonal dark beers and they aren't bad at all! I have sampled their Presidential Stout (fuzzy on the name but know had jalapeno hints in it) which had a unique and pleasant flavor as well as their Pecan Pie Porter which was interesting but didn't really do much for me.\n\nI love how AZW isn't afraid to try new things with their beers. Be it dropping a Pecan Pie or a Chocolate Bunny into the cask, you can expect something truly unique. My hopes are sometime soon I can enjoy a beer style more to my tastes.

If you choose the 3 course, you can select from the 'First Course' OR the 'Middle Course,' the 'Second Course' and 'Third Course.' BUT if you choose the 4 course, you can select one item from each ... but ultimately it's what you want!\"\n\nOh, okay. Well, we'll split a 4 course tasting so we can taste everything.\n\"Um, no sorry sir, you will have to do two 2 course meals.\" \n\nOkaaay.

A chef who very likely just wants to show off by forcing people to taste a multitude of offerings.\n\nPerhaps that is unfair, but from the wait staff's tense demeanour and near-embarrassment in walking you through the menu, it is clear that they are uncomfortable with the system of ordering. A system that is not helping the customer choose what they want and forcing the staff to make excuses and apologies.\n\nAnd this is unfortunate because they are PROUD of the food that comes out! They wax poetic on all of the dishes, but they are handcuffed by the system put in place.\n\nMy final complaint is the pricing. When you break it down, if these items were priced \"a la carte\" (which is maybe why they are not!), these prices would likely be higher than a restaurant like the Ranche or the Living Room, which I consider to be some of the nicer places to eat in the city.\n\nSo the summation of my long-winded plea to Q is this:\nYou have great food, you have a great location ... don't throw it away by being so rigid with dysfunctional set-up of your menu!

Honestly, it felt like they were trying to step up the service with specific talking points and direction. That's a plus in my book.\n\nThis place was fine. The second experience was better and we received MUCH better service when we ate inside. All in all, the food was mediocre, and were desserts are ok. I know they are popular, but they have the feel of a place who is still ironing out the wrinkles.  I don't plan to return, but with the modern decor and house music gently pumping in the background, I can see why others would.\n\n\nLEMON STORY: I asked for extra lemon with the shrimp (it came with one slice for three of us) and the server asked me if I wanted \"one\" lemon. Confused, I responded, \"Yes.\" I thought he was going to slice up one whole lemon and bring to to us. I mean, why else would he ask if I wanted \"one\" lemon when I asked for \"extra\"?\n\nInstead, he returned with ONE extra slice of lemon. That's a total of two lemon slices. We laughed at the incident and then ordered a second round of the shrimp because it was tasty. This time, when I asked for extra lemon, the same server didn't ask how many extra lemon slices I wanted, he just brought one additional slice.

First of all, rent is way too expensive and they raise it $30 every year.  When we moved in our rent was $1030 for a 2 bed/2 bath and I checked what it was renting out for before we moved out and it was up to over $1100!  Ridiculous.  The complex is nice but let's be honest, the location is kind of in the ghetto ESP. with Extended Stay America right there with cops there on a weekly basis.  We moved into a renovated apartment and after about a year, things just randomly started falling apart!  I opened a drawer one day and the front fell off, my boyfriend opened the closet and the mirror part literally fell apart, granite countertop cracked... It's obviously all very cheaply remodeled.  \nThe biggest complaint I have is the a/c unit was ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE.  We lived on the 2nd floor and our apartment would not cool down past 80 degrees and on a hot day- forget it.  It would run constantly, we'd set it on 80 and it would literally go up to 84 degrees!  Electric bill was $250!!  Maintenance came a few times and said nothing was wrong.  Umm really??  So miserable.  And the a/c control is in the kitchen.  WHY THE KITCHEN??  The hottest part of the apt cause you cook there!  So if you like to cook, you can forget doing so in the summer months... Your apt will go up 3 degrees.\nThe final straw was about 2 months before we moved out.  We heard something, look outside and there's literally a huge swarm of bees outside of our  window with hundreds of dead bees left on our patio!!!  Apparently there was a bee's nest and they sent pest control to kill it.  Absolutely no notice, no email, no courtesy call to say hey we're sending pest control to kill a huge nest so stay inside because there will probably be a swarm of bees outside of your apartment!!  We called immediately and management said \"sorry it's a Friday we can't do anything until Monday!\"  So the dead bees didn't get cleaned off of our patio until a week later, dead bees found in our light in our kitchen, AND a bee would get into our apt at least once a day and THEN my boyfriend gets stung by a bee at 4am in the middle of his sleep!!!!

We got both with thick noodles because the waiter recommended it, and we also both got extra noodles.

The original soup base had more flavour than the spicy one but definitely not enough. The spicy one just tasted off and bad, do not get it. Use the spicy salt that's given on table instead to make spicy. I basically almost used half the shaker to give my original a bit more taste. The chicken was good, soft, lots of flavour. They give lots of corn. \n\nI have had better ramen before, and won't be returning to this place unfortunately. I expected a lot more in taste.

I had joined the gym because it was close to my work and it was easy for me to get to during rush hours. The equipment and gym space is pretty outdated when comparing to other gyms, but I still went because of location. When I changed office locations, I went into my gym and asked to cancel my membership (there wasn't an LA Fitness near my new office and I wasn't happy with the equipment). The man at the front desk handed me paperwork, which I filled out and handed back to him.

He tells me again there is no \"proof\" of me coming in and that I will have to go in AGAIN or snail mail in the cancellation form from the website.

I do not waste my time on these reviews, but something needs to be done at this chandler location. I'm huge into purchasing electronics and I've never had such a horrific experience. I returned a computer to your chandler location and wow your managers are the worst I have ever came across. I paid $2800!!! for a Surface book that I ended up returning cause it's way over priced and the managers returned the computer but still billed my Dell preferred account $2800 dollars and gave me only $21 back of the $233.92 I paid cash. What the heck ?? And the manager was clueless and said they'll mail you a check! I asked where is my proof and receipt? He said there is none. Wow and that's your managers response? That is not how you handle a customer the spends $3000. I am not purchasing a toy, this should be a profession company who offers reliable support. So I waited a few days for the credit to go back and waited and waited until I realized I never got a receipt emailed to me. I've don't several returned and ever single time I received a receipt via email. So my suspicion rose and I called Dell and they told me No Mr. Cholak your credit balance is not clear and you owe us $2800!!!! So I call Microsoft and they said ok ok we'll email you a receipt. Still got nothing!!  So now I'm at a point where I returned a $2800 pc from Microsoft and I'm STILL getting billed for the full amount and not one manager or Microsoft representative gave a crap. I called Dell EVERY SINGLE day asking for a damn refund asking what is the problem. Oh and let's not forget I already called the chandler location countless times, I went to the store twice and every time they said oh it's Dells fault. So I called Dell for 3 weeks I probably spent a total of 10hours on the phone, because nobody at that location can take care of a customer and show some ownership. I finally started having Dell call out to the chandler store now because they asked me to EMAIL them The RECEIPT!!! Hahahaha what!!! It's 2017 and I spent $2800 on a computer and you guys don't have it on file that I RETURNED IT ?!?!! Are your employees fit for the job Microsoft? So all of this took 3 weeks to handle! Not one response from Microsoft, no apology for the inconvenience. They actually ended up telling Kevin ( Dell corporate escalation) that we are sorry, we messed up so bad that we cannot fix it. So Dell had to eat the whole thing and issue a credit to the cover the amount. The moral is nobody at the chandler location helped. I called Dell so many times and fixed it myself. I am not the one getting paid!! They are!! So the staff needs to fix it. They ignored me, every time I came in... made some silly lie to get me out and still have never contacted me about anything. Just another day and I understand that. I know there is way more important things but a company this large should never be this untrained.

We even offered to pay for our drinks. He tried giving us 25% off and even had printed the bills and tried making us pay with about a $5 discount.

He was rude and condescending to our group and that was a HUGE source of displeasure in this latest experience.  \n\nThey were busy and some of our group had not dined there before but the menu is not rocket science and can be managed.  The salads are massive so we ordered and mentioned that each couple would split them and he crinkled his nose and walked away.   I had an offer for a speciality free salad and he treated me like I fell off the turnip truck.   When the salads arrived he kinda threw them NOT SPLIT and the free one wherever they landed.  \n\nThe steak frites were amazing as always and they were enjoyed by all.  However, I ordered the warm chocolate cake with salted caramel cream and was given bread pudding.  His fatal mistake was telling me that's what I ordered.  It was a special and not even on the menu and I always order the same dessert.  He told me to try it because i would be happy with that dessert.  I wasn't and begrudgingly returned with a comped chocolate dessert.  \n\nThis is how crappy personnel can make or break your experience.....", "stars": 2.0}, {"text": "Just went here this past Sunday - Went in around 1 and had no problem getting a seat. (My friends went two weeks ago on a Wednesday evening and the wait was over an hour and half.) I think the atmosphere is pretty cool. It's very different compared to most PGH South Hills eateries.  There were these huge garage doors that I assume will be opened in the warmer months but it did make it very chilly. I'm happy I had my coat to wear during lunch. \n\nThe beers were very cool (a bit expensive but that's expected). The descriptions of the beers were on point! I think we tried all but 1 because they didn't have it available. I could easily crave some of these beers.\n\nThe food was lacking. I think the owners need to focus more on getting the customers substance in their food. For example, we ordered the cheese platter ($14). The platter came with 3 small pieces of toasted bread, scattered walnut bits that no one know what to do with, a few jumbo olives, and some standard cheeses. We asked for more toasted bread and about 10 minutes later, we got 4 more pieces. There were 5 of us - An appetizer that is over $9 should be able to feed more than 3 people.   They were also out of anything pretzel which was a letdown (understandable since this is still a new business). \n\nMy pizza was pretty amazing though! All of the pizzas sounded delicious - the ingredients were very fresh. Something that was off was that each additional topping was $2?? It's just not worth it here. It's really not. The rest of the table ordered sandwiches. Synopsis, nothing to write home about. The chips they give you on the side seemed like they were from a bag. The ones my boyfriend got seemed like they came from the bottom of the bag. When everyone was done eating, we all said we could definitely eat more. This also goes back to the substance point I made. \n\n I'm not sure if this place wants the customers to leave more room for the beer or not? If that's the case then they need to lower the food prices. This place needs some time to figure out how to be \"cool/urban\" while also catering to the area. We like to eat, a lot!  I like that they have different options outside of usual wings, mozzarella sticks and fried zucchini selection that are a staple of the South Hills, but don't cheat us! I have high hopes for this place.

The ease of making the reservations online lead me to believe that the evening would be a smooth and enjoyable. \n\nUnfortunately that evening my husband was held up at work and we were about an half an hour later than our reservation. The host at the restaurant did a wonderful job seating our party and starting the meal as we had texted the family explaining our situation. Even upon our arrival, the servers were very helpful in getting my husband and me seated. As the meats were circulated to our table my husband and I had to continually catch the servers attention. Being a slightly larger party of eight, I did not think that was a number that would allow members to be overlooked. After about 45 minutes it seems the font of house manager noticed our issue and was very helpful sending servers to us and even asking if we were waiting for something particular.  But due to our later arrival as the rest of our party were enjoying conversation and the market bar, the meat stopped arriving along with all servers. They all seemed to have migrated to a different portion of the restaurant. \n\nThe other issue I had with the evening was that all the meat except the steak was very dry and over cooked. As our reservation was at 6pm, I can't imagine this was because the meat had cooked too long during service. It was a Thursday evening with I'm sure slower traffic than a weekend, but I would have thought the kitchen would be aware of how many reservations and on average how much of which dishes move during an evening and would adjust accordingly. Sadly to say that does not seem to be the case as chicken, pork, and even sausage were all dry and over cooked. \n\nThe bottom line is that I left an all you can eat restaurant hungry.

The other driver was not courteous enough to leave a note.  Our secondary concern was damage to the hood (also while unattended in a parking lot but some time earlier).\n\n911 Collision did a reasonable job on the bumper - covered under insurance after our $500 deductible was met.  The color doesn't exactly match but then it doesn't scream out either.  One of the people that works there told me that you can never get the color to match because the bumper is plastic and the body is sheet metal.  I'll go on record now by calling that out as complete hogwash - Detroit, Germany, and Japan do it all day long.  The color might be hard to match for a host of other plausible and legitimate reasons but not because one is metal and the other is plastic.\n\nSo we have established that, at best, the work is mediocre and they like to lie about it.  Now on to the hood.\n\nThe hood was originally quoted as a $1000 correction because they would have to paint the WHOLE FRONT COWL - hood, fenders, grill, bumper, etc.  All for two ding's no larger than a plug nickel.  And $1000 is the REDUCED price because we already had the car in their shop.  Normally it would have been more.\n\nWe decided that was too much and went with Option-B: they pop the dents, wet sand the area and then blend in a little touch up paint, wet sand again to smooth it out, clear the area and wet sand again.  All for $300.  Not bad - right?  Wrong.\n\nIt looks like all they did was pop the dents.  Is still isn't smooth, The scratches are very obvious, and I cant tell that it was wet sanded at all.  I think they just let the shop lackey have a crack at it with the touch up paint you get at Auto Zone.  Had I known that this is what $300 gets me, I would have passed.  It looks Rookie all the way.

Apparently their prices are now $20 for a head and $10 for refills, which is moderate, but unless they've changed the hookah I've never had it last long enough to be worth the $.\n\nFrom my experience, it's either love or hate. I've never met anyone to say that Nu was \"okay\" - but have certainly heard my sentiments echoed by many of my friends after their own terrible experiences (one friend, after making reservations a week in advance, was forced to wait 45 minutes for a table.

Here is some of what I wrote the company: \n\nThe night started for our party of 11 with an offer to sit in a setting made for 8. After explaining our dilemma, which should have been blatantly obvious to the most inexperienced persons, we were informed to try and \"squeeze in\". We were hoping that was a joke but disappointingly, it was not. This was, of course, after we had confirmed our reservation for 11. Not just confirmed our party of 11 once, not even confirmation of our party of 11 twice, but THREE times! Usually, thats all you get at bat but this horror show is just beginning. Perhaps 30 - 45 mins later, after the restaurant cleared a bit after our 7:30pm reservation, we were offered a larger table. OK, so our night started off poorly (well, lets just say poorly is too mild a word and it would be more appropriately deemed bad already). We had hopes that things would be better as for most of us, this is a first time experience with this restaurant. Next came our experience with finding mold on the bread from your infamous \"all-you-can-eat bread station\". Not quite the dining experience we had hoped for. I would had hopes that some sort of management personnel would have AT LEAST visited us to explain the screw up with our table but having an absence for that event, I would have EXPECTED an IMMEDIATE visit surely after the mold. Unfortunately, our disappointment with Pacini is only beginning. We had insisted to speak with the manager after this. Andy came and explained how he noticed the screw up in the reservation and wondered how they were going to fix that. He explained how he spoken with the \"new\" staff that made such a mistake. I explained how our confirmed came in threes and that I would have presumed that at last one, if not two persons should have seen the mistake. Of course, given that we made our reservation almost a week in advance, one would presume that someone, anyone, should have informed us prior to our arrival. Not even upon our arrival did anyone inform us of the mistake or the dilemma but only an offer of a \"tight squeeze\". I am sure I have never had to \"squeeze in\" even at MacDonalds! The topping to our evening, and I was most certain this HAD to be a feeble attempt at a Candid Camera episode, was that I had the misfortune of ordering the Seafood Linguini. As our party had now been waiting for our dinner way past our patience, I found an unopened mussel in my order. Does the cook know how to cook? Does anyone check the plates before they are sent to the customers? Did the manager have temporary amnesia and forgotten that he had a whole table of already dissatisfied customers? Now I am left wondering if anyone in the whole entire restaurant even trained for their job. After the whole Gong Show we went through, even after speaking with a manager, and as if to add salt to injury, I would have PRESUMED that he or someone, would have at least made an attempt to salvage the rest of our evening. After obviously sending the Seafood Linguini back, I had waited way too long for my remake. The waitress, after about 25 mins, came back to double check that I did not want another order. YOU HAVE GOT TO BE KIDDING! There wasn't even an attempt to make that right???!!!!! After 25 mins??? I was certain they would have rushed that remake! What more can I say. Dinner time was obviously over. Correction, dessert and after dinner drink and conversation time is obviously over but not even an attempt? That's just wrong for any restaurant to have any customers leave hungry! That should be your number one motto if you do not already have that in your training manual and corporate mission.

Coupled with another truck that we wanted to try, we talked about it for weeks! Keep in mind that I write these reviews not just to help the customers be wise consumers, but also so that business owners can get feedback from customers and gain insight into running their business in the most successful manner. With that said, I struggle with this review. The company has really been well marketed and over hyped! The truck is beautiful and as up to date as possible. The line was extremely long and it took quite a while for food to come out. While waiting in line I noticed that several people were complaining and returning food! I was honestly pretty worried at that point and tried to hear why they were coming back. The complaints were all the same. The lobster rolls they had ordered were supposed to be hot and that the lobster was cold. I asked one lady what was wrong with her food and she told me that it was ice cold in the middle. People were not complaining about the line to order. They were complaining about the wait for their food. There was a huge group of people waiting for food. Suddenly a woman appeared frantically trying to get into the truck's front door which was locked. She had Walmart bags in her arms. I said to my wife that she must have made a Walmart run for Lobster (We were in the parking lot for Sam's Club and next to the Walmart.) I was joking but I think she went to get bread. That's right my \"roll\" was on bread. I would say it was Texas Toast to be exact. So, it was my turn to order. The guy is taking orders from the window which is quite high, and I had trouble hearing him. He used a tablet to have me sign for my debit card. They ask for an optional tip which I find absurd when no one is doing anything worth tipping. They didn't bring my food and as a matter of fact I had to ask for a napkin and a fork. When I went back to get a knife the lady was very nice, but I still wouldn't say it was worthy of even more money. I must admit that I was taken back by the price. I know that lobster can be expensive, but this is extremely expensive for the size of roll you get. It is about double what I think it is worth. Our order did not take too long to get (about 8 minutes). I guess once the cook came back it was easier to pump out food. By the way I watched to see if she washed her hands and she did.  The man called our name over the loud speaker that is useless! I didn't see anyone else go to the window, so I figured it must be mine. Anyway, we got our food and I was shocked at how small it was. My wife and I always split food. I could eat three of these on my own! We each took our two bites and the Lobster is wonderful. It has a wonderful sweet flavor. There was a small line of mayo on the Texas toast that did not make much difference. I would double the mayo but that is me. It was lobster on bread. Well the wait was over and in two bites the meal was over. I looked at my wife and laughed. I said, \"well that was a big bubble buster!\" She said she thought the flavor was great but that the $20 we spent was not worth it. For the record the roll was $16.50 plus tax and tip. I felt a little robbed to be honest. I am the type of person that tips huge amounts for great service and doesn't mind paying a lot of money for quality food and service. In this case it was a bit much. Let's not forget this is a food truck. They don't even have the overhead of a brick and mortar restaurant!

The map is deceiving. It makes it look like the rail stops in convenient areas right along the strip, at some of the popular locations like MGM, Harrahs, Flamingo but in reality, unless you are going to stay right in those hotels, Yoh will be doing some serious walking anywhere you go. I found it much more convenient and even cost efficient, to just take taxis. For example, we took the monorail to the very north end, which on the monorail map, appeared very close to Circus Circus, for the kids to to play some games, but because the monorail drops you so far on the outskirts from the stop, we had to take a cab from monorail to circus circus. That was the case for almost everywhere we had to go, so we wasted $60 on monorail fees for family of 4 (in addition to Cab fees). Would have been easier and more cost efficient to just pay for taxis form point A to B. Instead we  walked miles to get on monorail and then back to strip from monorail.

After about 30 minutes with no one coming to our table for us to reorder a cocktail I finally got up & asked a server if I could order a drink and also questioned where our appetizer soup was. She informed me the kitchen had been backed up and she would check on the soup. She ordered us a new drink which came quick. It must have been close to 40 minutes when the food finally arrived. If the soup could have come quicker \"appetizer\"  it could have really filled the long gap of NO service/food. The whole fried fish was extremely over fried. There was hardly any meat on it & likely was like that since it was just way over cooked. We added one more dish since the fish was so small and made sure to ask if the kitchen was caught up. At this point half the tables had left. She said yea it shouldn't be that long... what do ya know. Another 20+ plus minutes for fried shrimp. We actually asked for the check and to cancel the shrimp. It ended up arriving right then. I left a 10% tip...that was VERY hard for me to do. I still manage to always tip the normal 22% even when service is not to well, so this 10% tip means it was pretty bad for me. You guys need to completely reestablish all steps of services. There is no formal greeting when the server came to the table. There was 3 different people to the table before ordering food. I would expect some sort of introduction, drink order and going over the menu or at least checking if I had any questions on the menu. I am not sure if this place is a \"pulled room\", but we had all 5 servers in there at some point for each trip they made to the table. Your biggest down fall is COMMUNICATION. If your kitchen is backed up, just let me know! Do not let a table sit for 40 minutes with never checking for drinks or informing of kitchen times. Every server was busy doing something, but never slowing their pace passing each guest to  \"table touch\" or giving someone the opportunity to even ask for something. That's the reason I had to physically get up to ask for everything I needed. The table next to us got their food and she then said \"I am still waiting for my tea\". If the tea had been forgotten, the problem would have been fixed if a server touched that table from the time the order was taken to the time the food arrived. There is no system with the staff. One lady that ended up taking our food order who I \"thought was our server\" was then busy behind the empty bar the entire time after...Tables were being bussed by the servers  while the present guests were sitting needing service. If you guys had some strict steps of service, great intro when greeting a table and most importantly COMMUNICATION you would receive amazing reviews and happy guests returning. All the staff was nice and spoke good English which stands out with Thai restaurants here in Las Vegas. The decor was up to date/modern and the restaurant was clean.. also another plus compared to most Thai restaurants here in Vegas. It's not like the food was bad. I would be willing to give them another try if they could dial in the service. The last dish, fried shrimp with tamarind was actually awesome.

There has to be better service. \nI hit a coyote on the frwy and it did quite a number on my Dodge Journey. I had it towed to Surprise Dodge and the service manager greeted me and started my paperwork. He turned me over to a service advisor and things seemed wonderful.  A few days later, the advisor said he ordered parts and was just waiting on a phone call from my insurance adjuster. My adjuster called me after he inspected my vehicle and said that he wanted different parts ordered and he gave the list of those parts to my advisor so he could order them. A week later I called to get a status on the vehicle and the advisor said he was still waiting on my insurance company to send him the parts. After a phone call from my insurance company to Dodge, my advisor realized he failed to order the parts and we now had to wait for those parts to come in. Apparently at this dealership only one mechanic is assigned to your vehicle so when he is not working, your vehicle just sits. What should have taken 7 to 10 days to fix, took over 3 weeks. When I'd call to get updates, I was always sent to my advisors voice mail because he never answers and nobody else will give you an update.  When he called to tell me the car was ready, he said he would be there until 5pm. I arrived at 4:30pm, and he'd already left for the day.  Another advisor had to look around to find my paperwork to help me out.  When my vehicle was pulled up, there was still something hanging down from under the car. A foreman came out, got under the car and said it was fine. The next day I got in the car and the outside temperature gauge was reading over 140 degrees. I took it back in and the advisor said, oh yeah - we forgot to put some things back on your car before we released it back to you.  After complaining to the service manager about the initial time that my car sat doing nothing because the advisor failed to order parts, I was given two years of oil changes.  Great. I thought, ok, they make things right. Awesome. But .....  I just took it in yesterday for an oil change. Woke up this morning to a huge oil spots on the driveway.

What do you want?\"  friendly eh? I told her I was trying to find out if they had a particular baby gate in stock and told her which one. I was put on hold again. A few minutes later, someone answers from babies r us and I explain again what I am looking for. I was put on hold again. A few more minutes later she comes back on and asks more about the gate I am looking for. I told her again and said it's the one on sale. She said they have them in, they don't show that they are on sale but if they show on sale online I can get it for that price. \n\nWhen I got there, I found the gates easily enough.

My boyfriend got me a gift certificate to The Modern Body for a full hour long massage of my choice and a shellac manicure and shellac pedicure - a dream day! Every single step of this entire day, from booking my appointment to what happened at the spa, was an unacceptable train wreck of a disaster.\n\nLet me start with the booking process... I phoned several times to the Spa and always got the voicemail. I left a message with the date and time of my call, along with the reason (to fulfill my certificate). I was specific about what I wanted and hoped to hear back within 24 hours - which is in my opinion a reasonable amount of time. A few days later, I finally got a call back from the owner who then told me it was easiest to use their website to book appointments, and could I just do that. I was a little bit confused, considering we were ALREADY speaking on the phone and she simply could have jotted down my appointment times, rather than hang up and direct me to their website. So, in a bit of shock, I did that. The website is horrendous... it is incomplete with placeholder Latin text abound and was not easy to navigate. I tried to select my services using their online booking system and when I selected \"gift certificate\" as my payment choice, I was instructed to enter the code on my certificate... glancing at my certificate, there was no code. I called back to receive the voicemail yet again, and had to wait to hear back. When I finally did get in touch with the owner again and explained what the issue was, she didn't seem very apologetic. I inquired about the different massages and she suggested a Therapeutic Massage - which I discovered the day of my appointments is their cheapest massage. I really should have at least chosen Hot Stone or Aromatherapy, but I felt like she didn't want me to choose anything above their lowest/cheapest option.\n\nI arrived at Modern Body on the day of my mani/pedi/massage about 15min before my appointment. I did enjoy the interior of the spa, it was very relaxing and feminine. I was not offered anything to drink - no tea, water, or coffee - which was a bit odd to me. Even my hair stylist gives me coffee. What's more is there was a shelf of water behind the desk, so obviously it is something they are supposed to offer. I was given a clipboard and asked to fill out some paperwork, which is standard and fine. As I was filling out the forms, a man entered the spa and loudly announced \"MY KNEE HURTS.\" I was a little confused, because I had no idea who this man was, or why he thought we cared about his knee. It was at this point (5min to my appointment) that I was informed she was \"fitting in a quick massage\" before me, and just disappeared with this guy into the back. I was totally shocked and appalled. Not only is that super unprofessional and rude, but it just showed that this owner cares more about her dollar than her customers. I wasn't informed about anything - was this a quick massage? An hour? Why did she not tell him she already had a booking and couldn't fit him in?? I called my boyfriend and explained my unhappiness and asked if I should just leave - he told me to wait it out and see how it went, so I did.\n\nAbout 30min passed and the man and owner came back out, and she gave him a bottle of water. I am not sure what \"strike\" this was - but it was definitely past 3. She then asked me to come back into the massage room. The room itself was was nice and warm. The massage itself was so-so. It was supposed to be a full body but she focussed primarily on my back and did not do my neck, feet, or front of my chest at all. Her work on my arms and legs was nominal at best. I am not even sure the massage was a full hour since my appointment time was skewed - but it didn't feel like an hour's worth. At that point she simply said \"You're done\" and left the room - and it turns out, the spa as well! She didn't direct me to the shower and offer if I wanted to rinse all of the oil off, give me a robe, or anything. So, covered in oil, I put my clothes back on and awkwardly stood in the spa waiting to see if my aesthetician was ready to do my mani/pedi.\n\nThe woman appeared and brought me into a back room. This room was not very nice... it was cramped and the polishes were just jammed into a basket, not lined up on display or anything which made it hard to decide on a colour. I sat down in the pedi chair and was told she didn't have the shellac machine, as it was at home. She offered me a regular pedi which I don't do, and my man paid extra for shellac. I asked if she could at least wax my brows, but her wax wasn't on so it wasn't possible. She also complained about her immigration problems for the 10min I was in her room.\n\nOverall I would never return or recommend it.

I passed on extra recommended service and had brake work, transmission fluid replacement and radiator flush completed elsewhere for $400 less.\n\nI will not return to Humberview for service or sales in the future.  Service arrangement confusion was frustrating and clearly the dealer is gouging consumers on service costs.  One always needs to be vigilant in managing finances but it was disheartening to come across yet another car dealer that is literally willing to waste a customers time as well reach into my wallet for $400 (theft).  Dealers depend on the inconvenience in shopping for better pricing on service to justify stealing from their clients and it appears that Humberview is full on for this scam.  The opposite should be true as I am certain that economy of scale (in that Humberview likely enjoys higher daily/weekly volume of service appointments) should allow this dealer to be competitive on service pricing.\n\nWill never return.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "2nd time there for lunch. First time had sushi and very good, though napkins were dirty. 2nd time had hibatchi vegetable and was shocked at how small the portion was. Food came to table 10 minutes after my lunch partners did - no appology for delay (how hard is it to make vegy hibatchi?)  Spring roll came 5 minutes after that. Staff seemed unorganized. Will probably not go back. Again, small portions and no appologies for delays!!", "stars": 3.0}, {"text": "I am all over town during my day.  When I have to get gasoline, I want it to be quick and I am on my way.\n\nI am very displeased at the gas pump set up at South Decatur and the 215 Beltway.  I pulled up to the first pump and I was confused as there was no keypad, no card reader and there seemed to be no way to operate the pump.  So I figured it was out of order.  I got in my car, drove to a second pump.  There was a keypad but no card reader.  There were no instructions.  I looked all over the advertising, the pump and I figured I was going to have to go in.  \n\nBeing forced to go into the store is irritating to me because I want to get going on my way as soon as possible.  If the management thinks that making you come inside is the way to increase C Store sales, that is wrong on two counts.  I am not going to buy from the store because you are costing me time and hassle that I don't have to deal with from other stores.  Secondly, you are losing money on gas revenue because I have to guess how much to put into my tank instead of just filling up.  To fill up would have purchased probably another $10.00 of gas, but I am not going to put myself in a situation where I have to come back in again, deal with a line to settle the difference.  Competing gas stations are not set up this way.  This set up feels like a backward way of doing business and it does not motivate me to want to trade here.\n\nMy gas receipt said it was Qaraman Sunset/Decatur.  \n\nThe attendant did offer to keep my card and ID at the register so I could fill up.  In this day and age?  No way.  \n\nSo I'll be on my way.", "stars": 1.0}, {"text": "This is not your typical store.  it has interesting things for those with alternative life styles, and for people with certain fetishes.

You pay for the entertainment thats why it's so expensive. The servers were very nice except for the manager. It was the third time I ate there and it was a little busy than usual.
